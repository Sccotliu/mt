plug_in_prog_parent_program includes a framework called Plug-in Manager that integrates new solutions into the existing plug_in_prog_parent_program environment.
None of the plug-in solutions currently support IPv6.
Some native plug_in_prog_parent_program features are licensed separately and activated through Plug-in Manager.
Plug-in programs are not part of the plug_in_prog_parent_program program.
The plug-in programs have separate licenses and management consoles.
Access the management consoles from within the plug_in_prog_parent_program web console.
Examples of plug-in programs are Trend Micro OfficeScan ToolBox and Trend Micro Security (for Mac).
Refer to specific plug-in program documentation for details on configuring and managing the program.
However, manage policies carefully to avoid creating conflicting firewall policies and producing unexpected results.
See the Microsoft documentation for details on Windows Firewall.
The product_short_name firewall includes the following key features and benefits:
Web threats encompass a broad array of threats that originate from the Internet.
For example, web threat creators constantly change the version or variant used.
One goal is to steal information for subsequent sale.
The resulting impact is leakage of confidential information in the form of identity loss.
Users can choose to run Windows 10 in desktop mode or tablet mode.
The desktop mode is similar to the classic Windows Start screen.
New features include a scrolling touch screen interface, tiles, and toast notifications.
Tiles are similar to the desktop icons used in previous Windows releases.
Users click or tap on a tile to launch the application associated with the tile.
Live tiles provide users application-specific information that dynamically updates.
Applications can post information to tiles even when the application is not running

Active Directory integration allows you to take full advantage of the following features:
Manually or periodically synchronize the Active Directory structure with the product_short_name server to ensure data consistency.
Different types of virus/malware require different scan actions.
Customizing scan actions requires knowledge about virus/malware and can be a tedious task.
ActiveAction is a set of pre-configured scan actions for viruses/malware.
ActiveAction uses scan actions that are recommended by Trend Micro.
You do not have to spend time configuring the scan actions.
Virus writers constantly change the way virus/malware attack computer_device_plural.
The following table illustrates how ActiveAction handles each type of virus/malware.

Optimize virtual desktop protection by using Trend Micro Virtual Desktop Support.
This feature regulates tasks on trend_client_program_plural residing in a single virtual server.
Use this feature to prohibit agents from running scans or updating components at the same time.
Virtual Desktop Support recognizes that the agents are on the same physical server.
Virtual Desktop Support can be used on the following platforms:
To explain component duplication for the server, refer to the following scenario:
The difference between versions 171 and 175 is 2.
In other words, the server does not have versions 173 and 175.
This incremental pattern accounts for the difference between versions 171 and 175.
On the server, TMEndpointEdt merges version 171 with incremental pattern 171.175 to generate version 175.
The server has 1 incremental pattern (171.175) and the latest full pattern (version 175).
The server generates incremental patterns based on the other full patterns available on the server.
The server compares its current incremental patterns with the incremental patterns available on the ActiveUpdate server.
The server downloads the incremental patterns it does not have.
The TMEndpointEdt server downloads an additional 7 incremental patterns:
The server now has all the incremental patterns available on the ActiveUpdate server.
The latest full pattern and the 14 incremental patterns are made available to client_computer_plural.

Aside from the product_short_name server, Update Agents can update from custom update sources.
Custom update sources help reduce client_computer_single update traffic directed to the product_short_name server.
See  for steps to configure the list.
After you have set up and saved the list, the update process proceeds as follows:
The Update Agent updates from the first entry on the list.
Components: If enabled, the agent updates from the product_short_name server.
You can only update components from the Active Update server.
Domain settings, programs and hot fixes can only be downloaded from the server or Update Agents.
The ActiveUpdate server is not included in the Customized Update Source List.
Domain settings: If enabled, the agent updates from the product_short_name server.
OfficeScan agent programs and hot fixes: If enabled, the agent updates from the product_short_name server.
If unable to update from all possible sources, the Update Agent quits the update process.
The agent updates directly from the product_short_name server and disregards the update source list.
The ActiveUpdate server is the first entry in the Customized Update Source List.

The client_computer_single triggers Damage Cleanup Services before or after virus/malware scanning, depending on the scan type.
Standard cleanup: The trend_client_program_single performs any of the following actions during standard cleanup:
While providing proactive protection, advanced cleanup also results in a high number of false-positives.
The cleanup type (standard or advanced) depends on your selection.
Open TSC.ini and change the "DebugInfoLevel" value from 5 to 0.
Digital assets are files and data that an organization must protect against unauthorized transmission.
Administrators can define digital assets using the following data identifiers:
File attributes: File properties such as file type and file size.
Keyword lists: A list of special words or phrases.
Administrators cannot delete a data identifier that a DLP template is using.
Delete the template before deleting the data identifier.
DLP exceptions apply to the entire policy, including all rules defined within the policy.
Data Loss Prevention applies the exception settings to all transmissions before scanning for digital assets.

When selecting the computer_device to host the product_short_name server, consider the following:
product_short_name comes with a set of default policies, which you can modify or delete.
Use to allow client_computer_plural unrestricted access to the network
Allow all incoming and outgoing TCP/UDP traffic through ports 80 and 10319
Use when client_computer_plural have an MCP agent installation
Allow all incoming and outgoing TCP traffic through port 16372
Use when client_computer_plural need to access the ScanMail console
Use when client_computer_plural need to access the IMSS console
In this product_short_name version, the default scan method for fresh installations is smart scan.
A subdomain cannot have lesser permissions than its parent domain.
For the following procedure, the domain tree is as follows:
Go to the User Accounts: Step 3 Define Agent Tree Menu screen.
Select to View Logs and clear all other View and Configure check boxes.
This occurs because the Managers domain manages all of its subdomains.
Defining the Active Directory/IP Address Scope and Query
After defining the scope, start the query process.
To define an Active Directory scope, product_short_name must first be integrated with Active Directory.
On the Active Directory/IP Address Scope section, click Define Scope.
Select Use on-demand assessment to perform real-time queries and get more accurate results.
Disabling this option causes product_short_name to query the database instead of each trend_client_program_single.
Querying only the database can be quicker but is less accurate.
Click the plus or minus button to add or delete IP address ranges.
For a pure IPv4 product_short_name server, type an IPv4 address range.
For a pure IPv6 product_short_name server, type an IPv6 prefix and length.
For a dual-stack product_short_name server, type an IPv4 address range and/or IPv6 prefix and length.
The prefix length should therefore be between 112 and 128.
Under Advanced Setting, specify ports used by product_short_name servers to communicate with agents.
Setup randomly generates the port number during product_short_name server installation.
The port displays next to the IP address column.
Trend Micro recommends keeping a record of port numbers for your reference.
Repeat this step until you have all the port numbers you want to add.
When connection is not established, product_short_name immediately treats the éndpoint as unreachable.
To save the scope and start the query, click Save and re-assess.
To save the settings only, click Save only.
The Outside Server Management screen displays the result of the query.
The query may take a long time to complete, especially if the query scope is broad.
Do not perform another query until the Outside Server Management screen displays the result.
Otherwise, the current query session terminates and the query process restarts.
