Data collected is subject to the terms of the
Review the privacy statement before using Licensing Management Platform.
Data Loss Prevention evaluates condition statements from left to right.
Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements.
Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results.
[Data Identifier1] And [Data Identifier 2] Except [Data Identifier 3]
A file must satisfy [Data Identifier 1] and [Data Identifier 2] but not [Data Identifier 3].
A file must satisfy [Data Identifier 1] or [Data Identifier 2].
A file must be [an Adobe PDF document] or [a Microsoft Word document].
A file must not satisfy [Data Identifier 1].
A file must not be [a multimedia file].
In most cases, however, the first data identifier does not have an operator.
In the United States, Trend Micro representatives are available by phone or email:
An expression must include the characters you have specified.
Suffix refers to the last segment of an expression.
A suffix must include the characters you have specified and contain a certain number of characters.
An expression must have two segments separated by a character.
The character must be 1 byte in length.
The number of characters right of the separator must not exceed the maximum limit.
Create your own templates if you have configured data identifiers.
A template combines data identifiers and logical operators (And, Or, Except) to form condition statements.
For more information and examples on how condition statements and logical operators work, see .
Create customized expressions if none of the predefined expressions meet the company's requirements.
Become comfortable with expression syntax before creating expressions.
Refer to the predefined expressions for guidance on how to define valid expressions.
Note that Data Loss Prevention follows the expression formats defined in Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE).
For more information on PCRE, visit the following website:
Modify the expressions if they are causing false alarms or fine tune them to improve detections.
Administrators can choose from several criteria when creating expressions.
For details about the different criteria options, see .
A file must contain at least one keyword in the keyword list.
A file must contain all the keywords in the keyword list.
In addition, each keyword pair must be within characters of each other.
The following data does not match the criteria: DISK*******************WEB****USB(23 characters between "D" and "W")
This may reduce the likelihood of detecting sensitive data, especially in large files.
As the number increases, the area covered also increases but scanning time might be slower.
A file must contain one or more keywords in the keyword list.
If only one keyword was detected, its score must be higher than the threshold.
If there are several keywords, their combined score must be higher than the threshold.
Assign each keyword a score of 1 to 10.
Words or phrases that, by themselves, do not carry much weight can have lower scores.
Consider the scores that you assigned to the keywords when configuring the threshold.
Create customized keyword lists if none of the predefined keyword lists meet your requirements.
There are several criteria that you can choose from when configuring a keyword list.
Choose one of the following criteria for each keyword list:
For details regarding the criteria rules, see .
Digital assets are files and data that an organization must protect against unauthorized transmission.
Administrators can define digital assets using the following data identifiers:
File attributes: File properties such as file type and file size.
Keyword lists: A list of special words or phrases.
Administrators cannot delete a data identifier that a DLP template is using.
Delete the template before deleting the data identifier.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the expressions.
Click Import and then locate the .dat file containing the expressions.
A message appears, informing you if the import was successful.
If an expression to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
The name must not exceed expression_name_length bytes in length and cannot contain the following characters:
Type a description that does not exceed 256 bytes in length.
Type the expression and specify whether it is case-sensitive.
For example, if you are creating an expression for ID numbers, type a sample ID number.
This data is used for reference purposes only and will not appear elsewhere in the product.
Choose one of the following criteria and configure additional settings for the chosen criteria (see ):
Click Save if you are satisfied with the result.
Save the settings only if the testing was successful.
An expression that cannot detect any data wastes system resources and may impact performance.
An expression is data that has a certain structure.
Type a name for the file attribute list.
> < * ^ | & ? \ /
The asterisk is a wildcard, which represents a file’s actual name.
- *.*m matches the following files: ABC.dem, ABC.prm, ABC.sdcm
- *.m*r matches the following files: ABC.mgdr, ABC.mtp2r, ABC.mdmr
- *.fm? matches the following files: ABC.fme, ABC.fml, ABC.fmp
There is no need to add a space after a semicolon.
Type the minimum and maximum file sizes in bytes.
Both file sizes must be whole numbers larger than zero.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted filetype file containing the file attribute lists.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the file attribute lists.
If a file attribute list to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
Choose one of the following criteria and configure additional settings for the chosen criteria:
To add keywords by using the "import" option:
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .csv file containing the keywords.
Click Import and then locate the .csv file containing the keywords.
If a keyword to be imported already exists in the list, it will be skipped.
To delete keywords, select the keywords and click Delete.
Use the "export" feature to back up the keywords or to import them to another server.
All keywords in the keyword list will be exported.
It is not possible to export individual keywords.
Save the resulting .csv file to your preferred location.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted filetype file containing the keyword lists.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the keyword lists.
If a keyword list to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
Select data identifiers and then click the "add" icon.
Select multiple entries by pressing and holding the CTRL key and then selecting the data identifiers.
Use the search feature if you have a specific definition in mind.
You can type the full or partial name of the data identifier.
Each template can contain a maximum of 30 data identifiers.
To create a new expression, click Expressions and then click Add new expression.
In the screen that appears, configure settings for the expression.
In the screen that appears, configure settings for the file attribute list.
To create a new keyword list, click Keywords and then click Add new keyword.
In the screen that appears, configure settings for the keyword list.
To remove a data identifier from the list of selected identifiers, click the trash bin icon.
Below Preview, check the condition statement and make changes if this is not your intended statement.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the templates.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the templates.
If a template to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.

Hosted Email Security supports seamless single sign-on (SSO) using existing Active Directory corporate credentials.
Security tokens consist of a collection of identity claims, such as a user's name or role.
The federation server can be configured only for Intranet access to prevent exposure to the Internet.
Hosted Email Security currently supports either of the following for SSO:
Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0
Before configuring SSO settings, configure AD FS 2.0 or Azure AD to complete federation server settings.
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an open standard to prevent sender address forgery.
For example, which email servers they use to send email from their domain.
If, for example, the message comes from an unknown server, it can be considered as fake.
Evaluation of an SPF record can return any of the following results:
The SPF record designates the host to be allowed to send.
The SPF record has designated the host as NOT being allowed to send.
The SPF record specifies explicitly that nothing can be said about validity.
A permanent error has occurred (for example, badly formatted SPF record).
