Review the privacy statement before using Licensing Management Platform.
Data Loss Prevention evaluates condition statements from left to right.
Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements.
Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results.
In most cases, however, the first data identifier does not have an operator.
In the United States, Trend Micro representatives are available by phone or email:
An expression must include the characters you have specified.
Suffix refers to the last segment of an expression.
A suffix must include the characters you have specified and contain a certain number of characters.
An expression must have two segments separated by a character.
The character must be 1 byte in length.
The number of characters right of the separator must not exceed the maximum limit.
Create your own templates if you have configured data identifiers.
For more information and examples on how condition statements and logical operators work, see .
Become comfortable with expression syntax before creating expressions.
Refer to the predefined expressions for guidance on how to define valid expressions.
For more information on PCRE, visit the following website:
Modify the expressions if they are causing false alarms or fine tune them to improve detections.
Administrators can choose from several criteria when creating expressions.
For details about the different criteria options, see .
A file must contain at least one keyword in the keyword list.
A file must contain all the keywords in the keyword list.
In addition, each keyword pair must be within characters of each other.
This may reduce the likelihood of detecting sensitive data, especially in large files.
As the number increases, the area covered also increases but scanning time might be slower.
A file must contain one or more keywords in the keyword list.
If only one keyword was detected, its score must be higher than the threshold.
If there are several keywords, their combined score must be higher than the threshold.
Assign each keyword a score of 1 to 10.
Words or phrases that, by themselves, do not carry much weight can have lower scores.
Consider the scores that you assigned to the keywords when configuring the threshold.
Create customized keyword lists if none of the predefined keyword lists meet your requirements.
There are several criteria that you can choose from when configuring a keyword list.
Choose one of the following criteria for each keyword list:
For details regarding the criteria rules, see .
Digital assets are files and data that an organization must protect against unauthorized transmission.
Administrators can define digital assets using the following data identifiers:

Trend Micro Smart Protection Server provides the following features and benefits:
The corporate network will be better positioned to handle the threat of volume.
The kernel memory consumption on workstations is significantly lowered and increases minimally over time.
This reduces the bulk of the impact of a pattern update on many workstations.
Stops viruses/malware, Trojans, worms, plus new variants of these security risks.
Installing a Smart Protection Server in your network reduces the gateway bandwidth load.
Since the malware information is stored in the cloud, it is available instantly to all users.
High performance content delivery networks and local caching servers ensure minimum latency during the checking process.
Trend Micro Smart Protection Server includes the following new features and enhancements:
Enhanced Web Reputation Services by allowing incremental updates for the Web Blocking List.
Below are the options available on this screen.
This reduces the memory and network bandwidth usage when loading the Web Blocking List.
Displays blocked URLs that match entries in the following lists:
Reduction in the server load and resource usage.
A standalone Smart Protection Server can now support up to 25,000 Trend Micro OfficeScan 11 agents.
Widgets now get the data from the web server on a daily basis.
Fixed time out issues and some minor bugs.
Displays blocked URLs that match entries in the Trend Micro Smart Protection Server Blocked URL List.
Displays blocked URLs that match entries in the Smart Protection Network Web Blocking List.
Select one or more lists to display the corresponding logs.
Use this command only if there is a conflict with the current service port.
Smart Protection Server now supports VMware VMXNET 3 network adapter in an IPv6 environment.
Deep Discovery Advisor integration and the Virtual Analyzer list
The dashboard can now be displayed on devices that do not support Adobe Flash Player.
Smart Protection Servers use several algorithms for an efficient process that uses minimal network bandwidth usage.
Smart Protection Servers download this pattern from Trend Micro ActiveUpdate servers.
This pattern is used for Web Reputation queries.
Pattern updates are a response to security threats.
Smart Protection Network and Smart Protection Servers download the Smart Scan Pattern file from ActiveUpdate servers.
Trend Micro products that support Smart Protection Servers download Smart Scan Agent Patterns from ActiveUpdate servers.
Endpoints that are currently in your intranet use Smart Protection Servers for queries.
Agents installed on endpoints first perform scanning on the endpoint.
Endpoints connect to Smart Protection Server for queries.
Endpoints scan files using local resources such as the Smart Scan Agent Pattern file.
Smart Protection Server exists in the local network.
This is made available for users who have access to their local corporate network.
These servers are designed to localize operations to the corporate network to optimize efficiency.
Agents never send the entire file when using file reputation technology.
The risk of the file is determined using identification information.
This solution leverages file reputation and web reputation technology to detect security risks.
Patterns are delivered in batches from Trend Micro to endpoints.
Over time, there has been a significant increase in the volume of unique emerging threats.
This amounts to a growth rate that far outnumbers the volume of currently known security risks.
Going forward, the volume of security risks represents a new type of security risk.
It will then continue to scan sites and block users from accessing infected ones.
Web reputation blocks web pages based on their reputation ratings.
When enabled, Web reputation helps deter users from accessing malicious URLs.
Use logs to monitor the status of Smart Protection Server.
