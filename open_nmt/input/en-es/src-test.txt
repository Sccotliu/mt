Trend Micro Smart Protection Server provides the following features and benefits:
The corporate network will be better positioned to handle the threat of volume.
The overall "time to protect" against emerging threats is greatly decreased.
The kernel memory consumption on workstations is significantly lowered and increases minimally over time.
This reduces the bulk of the impact of a pattern update on many workstations.
Stops viruses/malware, Trojans, worms, plus new variants of these security risks.
Installing a Smart Protection Server in your network reduces the gateway bandwidth load.
File Reputation Services checks the reputation of each file against an extensive in-the-cloud database.
Since the malware information is stored in the cloud, it is available instantly to all users.
High performance content delivery networks and local caching servers ensure minimum latency during the checking process.
Trend Micro Smart Protection Server includes the following new features and enhancements:
Enhanced Web Reputation Services by allowing incremental updates for the Web Blocking List.
Below are the options available on this screen.
This reduces the memory and network bandwidth usage when loading the Web Blocking List.
Displays blocked URLs that match entries in the following lists:
Reduction in the server load and resource usage.
A standalone Smart Protection Server can now support up to 25,000 Trend Micro OfficeScan 11 agents.
Widgets now get the data from the web server on a daily basis.
Fixed time out issues and some minor bugs.
Displays blocked URLs that match entries in the Trend Micro Smart Protection Server Blocked URL List.
Displays blocked URLs that match entries in the Smart Protection Network Web Blocking List.
Select one or more lists to display the corresponding logs.
Use this command only if there is a conflict with the current service port.
Smart Protection Server now supports VMware VMXNET 3 network adapter in an IPv6 environment.

Deep Discovery Advisor integration and the Virtual Analyzer list
The Virtual Analyzer list is highly company-specific and provides a more customized defense against targeted attacks.
The dashboard can now be displayed on devices that do not support Adobe Flash Player.
Smart Protection Servers use several algorithms for an efficient process that uses minimal network bandwidth usage.
Smart Protection Servers download this pattern from Trend Micro ActiveUpdate servers.
This pattern is used for Web Reputation queries.
Pattern updates are a response to security threats.
Smart Protection Network and Smart Protection Servers download the Smart Scan Pattern file from ActiveUpdate servers.
Trend Micro products that support Smart Protection Servers download Smart Scan Agent Patterns from ActiveUpdate servers.
Endpoints that are currently in your intranet use Smart Protection Servers for queries.
Agents installed on endpoints first perform scanning on the endpoint.
Endpoints connect to Smart Protection Server for queries.
Endpoints scan files using local resources such as the Smart Scan Agent Pattern file.
Advanced filtering technology enables the agent to "cache" the query result.
The cloud-based query process makes use of two network-based technologies:
Smart Protection Server exists in the local network.
This is made available for users who have access to their local corporate network.
These servers are designed to localize operations to the corporate network to optimize efficiency.
These two network-based solutions host the majority of the virus/malware pattern definitions and web reputation scores.
Agents never send the entire file when using file reputation technology.
The risk of the file is determined using identification information.
How Does Trend Micro Smart Protection Server Work?
Trend Micro Smart Protection Server is a next-generation, in-the-cloud based, advanced protection solution.
This solution leverages file reputation and web reputation technology to detect security risks.
Patterns are delivered in batches from Trend Micro to endpoints.
Over time, there has been a significant increase in the volume of unique emerging threats.
This amounts to a growth rate that far outnumbers the volume of currently known security risks.
Going forward, the volume of security risks represents a new type of security risk.
It will then continue to scan sites and block users from accessing infected ones.
Web reputation blocks web pages based on their reputation ratings.
When enabled, Web reputation helps deter users from accessing malicious URLs.
Use logs to monitor the status of Smart Protection Server.
The Blocked Web Access Log screen displays information for Web Reputation queries that return malicious results.
These are the options available on this screen.
Specify keywords to use when searching for URLs.
Use the following to filter your log query:

The new group name appears in the agent tree.
Prepare the backup of the database files created during backup.
Use the attach option to attach the backup of the database files.
Manual Scan checks for security risks and also eradicates old infections to minimize reinfection.
The scanning duration depends on the computer's hardware resources and the number of files to scan.
During a Manual Scan, the agent performs a specific action against detected security risks.
The action is configured by the productname administrator.
Quick Scan: Scans areas of the endpoint typically targeted by security risks.
The pattern files on the agent contain information on the endpoint areas to scan.
Custom Scan: Scans the files or folders of your choice.
Run custom scan on files or folders that you suspect to be infected.
Full Scan: Scans all files, except encrypted and password-protected files.
Wait for the scan to finish and check the results.
You can stop or pause scanning while it is in progress.
Click Scan and choose one of the following scan options:
The agent receives updates automatically from the server.
When configuring the scan action, select from the following options:
ActiveAction is a set of pre-configured scan actions for different types of security risks.
Use the same action for all security risk types
For Probable Virus/Malware, the action is always "Pass".
If the first action is not "Clean", no second action is configurable.
Display a notification message when a security risk is detected
If Scheduled Scan is enabled on the endpoint, users can postpone and skip/stop Scheduled Scan.
Users with the "Postpone Scheduled Scan" privilege can perform the following actions:
Postpone Scheduled Scan before it runs and then specify the postpone duration.
If Scheduled Scan is in progress, users can stop scanning and restart it later.
Users then specify the amount of time that should elapse before scanning restarts.
When scanning restarts, all previously scanned files are scanned again.
Scheduled Scan can be stopped and then restarted only once.
Configure the number of hours and minutes, which corresponds to:
The maximum amount of time that should elapse before scanning restarts
This privilege allows users to perform the following actions:
Stop Scheduled Scan when it is in progress
Configure the timing for displaying the notification message, in number of minutes.
Automatically stop Scheduled Scan when scanning lasts more than __ hours and __ minutes
The agent immediately notifies users of any security risk detected during scanning.
The following are the actions Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can perform against security risks:
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) removes the infected file from the endpoint.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can delete, clean, or restore the file.
Restoring a file means moving it back to its original location without performing any action.
Users may restore the file if it is actually harmless.
To configure the second action, navigate to Agent ManagementSettings{Scan Type} and click the Action tab.
If actually harmless, probable virus/malware will no longer be detected.
For example, configure Real-time Scan to scan each file after it is downloaded to the endpoint.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will not scan a file if:
The file is located under the directory path specified in the scan exclusion list
The following table provides a comparison between the two scan methods:
Available in this version and all earlier versions.
The conventional scan agent performs scanning on the local endpoint.

The agent "caches" the scan query result to improve the scan performance.
All components available on the update source, except the Smart Scan Agent Pattern.
All components available on the update source, except the Virus Pattern and Spyware Active-monitoring Pattern.
agents can use one of two scan methods when scanning for security risks.
The scan methods are smart scan and conventional scan.
Agents that use smart scan are referred to as smart scan agents in this document.
Smart scan agents benefit from local scans and in-the-cloud queries provided by File Reputation Services.
Agents that do not use smart scan are called conventional scan agents.
A conventional scan agent stores all components on the agent endpoint and scans all files locally.
Initiate Scan Now on endpoints that you suspect to be infected.
The agent is not always able to perform a desired action on detected threats.
When this happens one of the following scan results will appear.
The infected file may be locked by another application, is executing, or is on a CD.
will delete the file after the application releases the file or after it has been executed.
The following scan results display in the virus/malware logs:
First action is Delete and the infected file was deleted.
First action is Clean but cleaning was unsuccessful.
Second action is Delete and the infected file was deleted.
First action is Quarantine and the infected file was quarantined.
Second action is Quarantine and the infected file was quarantined.
productname did not perform any action on the infected file.
Second action is Pass so productname did not perform any action on the infected file.
Quarantine is the second action, and both actions were unsuccessful.
Solution: See “Unable to quarantine the file” below.
Delete is the second action, and both actions were unsuccessful.
Solution: See “Unable to delete the file” below.
Type a full file path or directory path and then click Add.
