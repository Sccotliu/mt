Introduction
Trend Micro &trade; Mobile Security defends against the latest threats to mobile devices and helps protect your privacy. It connects to Trend Micro through the Internet to scan your apps for new threats as they arise. Integrated filters can stop unwanted telephone calls and text messages. It can block unsafe websites and websites unsuitable for children too.
Mobile Security provides integration with  Trend Micro Clean Tool  to remove threats that could not be easily removed and require special Android permissions to completely remove them from the mobile device.
Mobile Security can locate your mobile device, lock it, delete all of its data, or sound an alarm by remote control. It can also lock your mobile device automatically if anyone removes the SIM card. It includes password protection to help safeguard your privacy as well.
Trend Micro recommends removing  other apps that provide similar features before using Mobile Security.

Mobile Security can check for privacy risks on your mobile device in two ways:

Understanding Privacy Scanner Results
After a privacy scan, you can see what personal information an app may try to collect from your mobile device. Keep in mind that apps may secretly gather information for a legitimate purpose.
For example, a backup app might make copies of your photos on the Internet, and that behavior could trigger an alert. However, most risky apps try to gather information that they should not access. A weather app has no good reason to make copies of your photos, for instance.
Trend Micro &trade; Mobile Security can help you see if an app has legitimately collected information, and then you can decide if you want to keep the app. Mobile Security assigns a severity rating to each app:
High risk  apps can send out your personal and private information such as messages, photos, contacts, your phone number, audio recordings and so on.
Medium risk  apps can send out information about your location, your mobile device, or your specific identity.
Low risk  apps can  send out basic device information and user created content, such as unique device identifiers, information downloaded from the Internet and keystrokes. Apps that record audio clips, open camera, show advertisements in notifications, or add icons to the home screen are also Low risk apps.

The physical extent size cannot be changed because otherwise the space required by the currently defined logical volumes will be increased to more than the available space.
Confirm Physical Extent Change
This change in the value of the physical extent will require the sizes of the current logical volume requests to be rounded up in size to an integer multiple of the physical extent.This change will take affect immediately.
The physical extent size cannot be changed because the value selected (0.2f MB) is larger than the smallest physical volume (0.2f MB) in the volume group.
The physical extent size cannot be changed because the value selected (0.2f MB) is too large compared to the size of the smallest physical volume (0.2f MB) in the volume group.
Too small
This change in the value of the physical extent will waste substantial space on one or more of the physical volumes in the volume group.
The physical extent size cannot be changed because the resulting maximum logical volume size (0.2f MB) is smaller than one or more of the currently defined logical volumes.

Clone Drive ToolThis tool allows you to significantly reduce the amount of effort required to setup RAID arrays.  The idea is to take a source drive which has been prepared with the desired partitioning layout, and clone this layout onto other similar sized drives.  Then a RAID device can be created.NOTE: The source drive must have partitions which are restricted to be on that drive only, and can only contain unused software RAID partitions.  Other partition types are not allowed.EVERYTHING on the target drive(s) will be destroyed by this process.
