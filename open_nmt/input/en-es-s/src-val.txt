Data Loss Prevention evaluates condition statements from left to right.
Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements.
Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results.
A file must satisfy [Data Identifier 1] and [Data Identifier 2] but not [Data Identifier 3].
A file must satisfy [Data Identifier 1] or [Data Identifier 2].
A file must be [an Adobe PDF document] or [a Microsoft Word document].
A file must not satisfy [Data Identifier 1].
A file must not be [a multimedia file].
In most cases, however, the first data identifier does not have an operator.
In the United States, Trend Micro representatives are available by phone or email:
An expression must include the characters you have specified.
Suffix refers to the last segment of an expression.
A suffix must include the characters you have specified and contain a certain number of characters.
An expression must have two segments separated by a character.
The character must be 1 byte in length.
The number of characters right of the separator must not exceed the maximum limit.
Create your own templates if you have configured data identifiers.
A template combines data identifiers and logical operators (And, Or, Except) to form condition statements.
For more information and examples on how condition statements and logical operators work, see .
Create customized expressions if none of the predefined expressions meet the company's requirements.
Become comfortable with expression syntax before creating expressions.
Refer to the predefined expressions for guidance on how to define valid expressions.
Note that Data Loss Prevention follows the expression formats defined in Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE).
For more information on PCRE, visit the following website:
Modify the expressions if they are causing false alarms or fine tune them to improve detections.
Administrators can choose from several criteria when creating expressions.
For details about the different criteria options, see .
A file must contain at least one keyword in the keyword list.
A file must contain all the keywords in the keyword list.
In addition, each keyword pair must be within  characters of each other.
The following data does not match the criteria: DISK*******************WEB****USB(23 characters between "D" and "W")
This may reduce the likelihood of detecting sensitive data, especially in large files.
As the number increases, the area covered also increases but scanning time might be slower.
A file must contain one or more keywords in the keyword list.
If only one keyword was detected, its score must be higher than the threshold.
If there are several keywords, their combined score must be higher than the threshold.
Assign each keyword a score of 1 to 10.
Words or phrases that, by themselves, do not carry much weight can have lower scores.
Consider the scores that you assigned to the keywords when configuring the threshold.
Create customized keyword lists if none of the predefined keyword lists meet your requirements.
There are several criteria that you can choose from when configuring a keyword list.
Choose one of the following criteria for each keyword list:
For details regarding the criteria rules, see .
Digital assets are files and data that an organization must protect against unauthorized transmission.
Administrators can define digital assets using the following data identifiers:
File attributes: File properties such as file type and file size.
Keyword lists: A list of special words or phrases.
Administrators cannot delete a data identifier that a DLP template is using.
Delete the template before deleting the data identifier.

Type a description that does not exceed 256 bytes in length.
Type the expression and specify whether it is case-sensitive.
For example, if you are creating an expression for ID numbers, type a sample ID number.
This data is used for reference purposes only and will not appear elsewhere in the product.
Choose one of the following criteria and configure additional settings for the chosen criteria (see ):
Click Save if you are satisfied with the result.
Save the settings only if the testing was successful.
An expression that cannot detect any data wastes system resources and may impact performance.
An expression is data that has a certain structure.
Type a name for the file attribute list.
The asterisk is a wildcard, which represents a file’s actual name.
There is no need to add a space after a semicolon.

Just like physical letters, an email message has two sets of addresses:
the envelope address and the message header address.
If you select this option,  uses both addresses for matching.
However, note that message header addresses in the approved sender list cannot bypass IP reputation-based filtering.
Unless specified otherwise,  considers the envelope address as the common sender address.
Messages from john@example.com will still be delivered to that end user.
To access your web-based  administrator console, you need a computer with access to the Internet.
