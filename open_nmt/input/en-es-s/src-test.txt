If someone else learns your password, change it immediately.
The same password that protects the Vault also safeguards your overall security software settings.
Can I create files and folders directly in the Vault?
You can create folders directly in the Vault, but not files.
When you finish working on a sensitive file, move it into the Vault.
Yes, you can directly open files stored in the Vault.
Can I use the Vault like any Windows folder?
Trend Micro designed the vault for storing files and folders.
However, the Vault differs from a normal Windows folder in a few ways:
This tool can protect sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers or passwords for websites.
Select Enable password protection to prevent unauthorized changes to set a password.
Type your case-sensitive password in the Password field.

Once the window has closed, your subscription will no longer renew automatically.
How can I find my lost serial number?
Your account contains your serial number for this security software.
How do I regain access to the Vault after recovering my computer?
You need to report that your computer has been found through the Report Stolen service.
The Vault checks with this service regularly to determine the status of your computer.
After unsealing, the Vault will remain locked until you provide the correct password.
How do I renew or upgrade the software?
Clear instructions will automatically appear when the time comes to renew or upgrade your software.
How do I report my computer as lost or stolen?
If your computer is lost or stolen, seal the Vault immediately through the Report Stolen service.
To access the service, you need the email address and the password you provided during initialization.
Nobody can open a sealed Vault until you report the computer as found.
Follow the guidelines below to select a password that others will find difficult to guess:
Avoid names or words that would appear in a dictionary.
If using common words, use phonetic replacements to obscure them.
For example, you might use "l8" for the word "late," or "f@st_t@lk3r" instead of "fast talker."
Use a combination of mixed-case letters, numbers, and other characters.
How do I unlock or lock the Vault?
Right-click the Vault desktop icon and select the option you want.
You will need to provide a password when unlocking the Vault.

How does PC Health Checkup enhance my computer's performance?
How does PC Health Checkup make improvements to the registry?
PC Health Checkup scans for broken or invalid entries in the system registry, including the following:
If multiple programs share DLLs, then broken entries can affect them.
Programs use these paths to find help files.
Programs use these paths to find HTML help files.
Broken application paths result from removing programs improperly so that shortcuts do not work.
The reminders include a link that you can click to cancel your subscription, if you want.
If you do nothing, then your subscription will renew automatically.
You stay protected without ever touching another button.
The Vault provides a secure password-protected place to store your sensitive files.
The table illustrates what kinds of pages are blocked based on your protection strength.
How does this security software detect and handle viruses and spyware?
Your security software analyzes basic information about every file that you open, save, or download.
It will attempt to remove viruses from any infected files.
How soon can the Vault seal shut after I report my computer as lost or stolen?
You should never open such files or copy them onto your computer.
Your security software will delete the entire file or program.
You can retrieve your password using the email address you provided when setting up the Vault.
If you provided the wrong email address, then someone else might receive your password instead.
This tutorial explains how to scan your computer and interpret the results.
This tutorial explains how to protect against threats lurking on the Internet.
Learn how to protect yourself from web threats
Beware of poorly-worded email messages that implore you to check a commercial or financial account online.
Wireless networks that redirect your connection without encryption are considered risky.
Wireless networks that do not have an authentication process or a valid security certificate rank as dangerous.

The scan removed a threat from a file.
The scan deleted spyware or a file with an unremovable threat.
Your computer needs to restart for one of the following reasons:
Restarting will empty the memory to remove the final remnants of a threat.
Implementing a software update requires the operating system to launch again.
You should save any open files, and then restart your computer.
Your security software can find and stop such threats before they start to cause trouble.
Use the dropdown lists under the checkbox to choose exactly when the scan should begin.
Friday at noon might be convenient, for example.
After setting the schedule, you must also decide which kind of scan you prefer.
Checks operating system files and other key locations where malicious software tends to hide.
This scan generally finishes fairly quickly, especially if you have a powerful computer.
Although it takes longer, this scan is very thorough.
When you delete a file, Microsoft Windows just removes the directory information used to find it.
Overwrites unwanted files with random data, so that nobody can easily open them again
Should the Vault be locked or unlocked after I restart my computer?
When your computer restarts, the Vault will be locked for your protection.
The Vault also locks when your computer returns from Screen Saver mode.
Social Networking Protection keeps you safe from security risks when visiting these social networking sites:
Important warnings appear when your security software deals with a threat.
Select Display a warning after detecting viruses, spyware, or suspicious behavior to make sure you see these messages.

Most computers have several programs and services that start automatically when your computer does.
Many of these programs and services, including security software, must remain in memory for your benefit.
However, computers with limited memory that run too many programs can slow down or become unresponsive.
Such programs then take unwanted actions, often in secret, compromising your security.
These programs can capture information from or take control of your computer without your informed consent.
Some spyware programs just keep track of the websites you visit.
Websites that attempt to transmit hidden viruses, spyware, or similar threats to your computer
PC Health Checkup can make the following enhancements:
You can use the space recovered to store more programs and files.
Most computers have several programs and services that start automatically when Windows opens.
If you thoroughly understand how Windows works, you can also choose to adjust other autostart settings.
The system registry contains all of your Windows and program settings.
Unused, broken, or invalid entries cluttering the registry can affect your computer's stability and performance.
Sometimes they can even prevent you from installing applications or starting Windows.
PC Health Checkup can find and remove unneeded registry entries.
Websites use small text files called cookies to provide you with customized content or services.
Your browser history lets you easily revisit websites.
To help protect your privacy, PC Health Checkup can delete cookies and browser history entries.
A file containing a security threat was deleted for one of the following reasons:
The threat could not be cleaned from the file and would put your security at risk.
This should happen only if the threat has damaged the file.
The file was suspected spyware or another type of intrinsically dangerous program.
The problem most likely resulted from your computer having problems connecting with the Internet.
You have tried to connect with a network that could pose a threat to your security.
Your security software will identify these networks as either risky or dangerous.
"Open" networks do not require authentication to connect with them, so anyone can use them.
You should try not to use risky networks if possible.
When you connect to a network, your computer will normally contact an authentication server.
For your own safety, you should avoid networks identified as dangerous.
Some or all of the features designed to protect you have been disabled.
The Trend Micro icon in the Windows system tray will look like one of these examples:
Some of the features protecting you have been disabled.
What changes can I undo after a check up?
You cannot completely undo all of the changes made by the PC Health Checkup.
