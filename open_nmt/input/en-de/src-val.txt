Data Loss Prevention evaluates condition statements from left to right.
Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements.
Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results.
In most cases, however, the first data identifier does not have an operator.
In the United States, Trend Micro representatives are available by phone or email:
An expression must include the characters you have specified.
Suffix refers to the last segment of an expression.
A suffix must include the characters you have specified and contain a certain number of characters.
An expression must have two segments separated by a character.
The character must be 1 byte in length.
The number of characters right of the separator must not exceed the maximum limit.
Create your own templates if you have configured data identifiers.
For more information and examples on how condition statements and logical operators work, see .
Become comfortable with expression syntax before creating expressions.
Refer to the predefined expressions for guidance on how to define valid expressions.
For more information on PCRE, visit the following website:
Modify the expressions if they are causing false alarms or fine tune them to improve detections.
Administrators can choose from several criteria when creating expressions.
For details about the different criteria options, see .
A file must contain at least one keyword in the keyword list.
A file must contain all the keywords in the keyword list.
In addition, each keyword pair must be within characters of each other.
This may reduce the likelihood of detecting sensitive data, especially in large files.
As the number increases, the area covered also increases but scanning time might be slower.
A file must contain one or more keywords in the keyword list.
If only one keyword was detected, its score must be higher than the threshold.
If there are several keywords, their combined score must be higher than the threshold.
Assign each keyword a score of 1 to 10.
Words or phrases that, by themselves, do not carry much weight can have lower scores.
Consider the scores that you assigned to the keywords when configuring the threshold.
Create customized keyword lists if none of the predefined keyword lists meet your requirements.
There are several criteria that you can choose from when configuring a keyword list.
Choose one of the following criteria for each keyword list:

One PolicyServer database may have one Enterprise configuration.
The PolicyServer Microsoft SQL database securely stores all user, device, and log data.
The database is either configured on a dedicated server or added to an existing SQL cluster.
The log and other databases can reside separately.
Starting from 5.0, all agents use Service to communicate with PolicyServer.
After a user authenticates, PolicyServer generates a token related to the specific policy configuration.
Until the user authenticates, the service denies all policy transactions.
For information about deployment scenarios, see the Installation and Migration Guide.
Under certain situations, SOAP may allow insecure policy transactions without user authentication.
Legacy Web Service filters SOAP calls by requiring authentication and limiting the commands that SOAP accepts.
Adding a user to the Enterprise does not assign the user to any groups.
Adding a user to a group adds the user to the group and to the Enterprise.
While frozen, the user is unable to log on devices.
That user is treated as a group administrator or group authenticator.
The new user is added to the selected group and to the Enterprise.
The user can now log on to devices.
Groups simplify managing agents, users, policies, subgroups, and devices.
Enterprise administrators and authenticators may not be added to groups because their permissions supercede all groups.

Add and modify groups directly from the left pane of PolicyServer MMC.
Groups in PolicyServer MMC can be assigned as follows:
Top Group: Top Groups are the highest level of groups under the Enterprise.
Each Top Group has a unique node underneath the Enterprise.
Subgroups may not be more permissive than the Top Group.
You must manually assign devices and users to each subgroup.
Adding users to a subgroup does not automatically add the users to the Top Group.
However, you can add users to both the Top Group and subgroup.
PolicyServer maintains a user directory separate from the Active Directory database.
This allows PolicyServer absolute security over access to all devices, user rights, and authentication methods.
For information about configuring Active Directory integration, see the Installation and Migration Guide.
