PolicyServer also enforces secure authentication and provides real-time auditing and reporting tools to ensure regulatory compliance.
You can flexibly manage PolicyServer with PolicyServer MMC or with .
One PolicyServer database may have one Enterprise configuration.
The PolicyServer Microsoft SQL database securely stores all user, device, and log data.
The database is either configured on a dedicated server or added to an existing SQL cluster.
The log and other databases can reside separately.
Starting from 5.0, all agents use Service to communicate with PolicyServer.
Endpoint Encryption Service uses a Representational State Transfer web API (RESTful) with an AES-GCM encryption algorithm.
After a user authenticates, PolicyServer generates a token related to the specific policy configuration.
Until the user authenticates, the service denies all policy transactions.
For information about deployment scenarios, see the Installation and Migration Guide.
All 3.1.3 and earlier agents use Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to communicate with PolicyServer.
Under certain situations, SOAP may allow insecure policy transactions without user authentication.
Legacy Web Service filters SOAP calls by requiring authentication and limiting the commands that SOAP accepts.

Groups in PolicyServer MMC can be assigned as follows:
Top Group: Top Groups are the highest level of groups under the Enterprise.
Each Top Group has a unique node underneath the Enterprise.
Subgroups may not be more permissive than the Top Group.
You must manually assign devices and users to each subgroup.
Adding users to a subgroup does not automatically add the users to the Top Group.
However, you can add users to both the Top Group and subgroup.
PolicyServer maintains a user directory separate from the Active Directory database.
This allows PolicyServer absolute security over access to all devices, user rights, and authentication methods.
For information about configuring Active Directory integration, see the Installation and Migration Guide.

A web server that hosts the Control Manager web console
A mail server that delivers event notifications through email messages
MCP handles the Control Manager server interaction with managed products that support the next generation agent.
MCP is the new backbone for the Control Manager system.
MCP agents install with managed products and use one/two way communication to communicate with Control Manager.
MCP agents poll Control Manager for instructions and updates.
Handles the Control Manager server interaction with older managed products.
It is a component of the Trend Micro Management Infrastructure (TMI).
Communicators handle all communication between the Control Manager server and older managed products.
They interact with Control Manager 2.x agents to communicate with older managed products.
Agents interact with the managed product and Communicator.
An agent serves as the bridge between managed product and communicator.
Therefore, install agents on the same computer as managed products.
It lets you administer the Control Manager network from any computer using a compatible web browser.
Allows an administrator to create a customized dashboard to monitor the Control Manager network.
The following are the Control Manager issues and limitations:

An example of editing policies with ranges is the Failed Login Attempts Allowed policy.
It is not possible to extend the minimum and maximum values.
Some policies have an editable text string for single array arguments.
Specify the sequence of characters for this policy in the Policy Value field, .
Editing Policies with True/False or Yes/ No Responses
Some policies only have True/False or Yes/No options.
A Group Administrator can define whether the Full Disk Encryption preboot appears before Windows starts.
The Policy Value field sets whether the policy is turned on.
