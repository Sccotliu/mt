The files to clean may be temporary files needed for Windows operation.
Infected files in Windows Temp Folder or Internet Explorer Temporary Folder
The last command deletes all files in the Recycle Bin.
Solution on Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 with NTFS File System:
If successfully cleaned, you do not need to keep the backup copy of the infected file.
Remove the password protection which allows for the cleaning of the file.
The propagation usually takes place through network connections or email attachments.
The Virus Cleanup Engine and Virus Cleanup Template remove Trojans.
Trojans do not infect files, thus cleaning is not necessary.
The file is locked or is currently executing.
The temp directory that acts as a repository for files requiring cleaning is full
An unexpected problem prevents the Messaging Security Agent from cleaning, such as:
The Messaging Security Agent does not support all compression forms.
To stop an executable from executing, the Messaging Security Agent must completely remove it.
The file contains a Trojan, worm, or other malicious code.
Some common reasons why the Messaging Security Agent cannot perform the clean action are as follows:
The file was isolated in a specific folder to prevent it from causing any issues.
Trend Micro will reexamine the file to determine the appropriate action to perform.
No action was performed on the detected file because the file is suspicious but unverified.
An infected file was restored to normal and no longer poses a threat.
Users were prevented from opening or running the file.
When a content violation occurs, the Messaging Security Agent takes action against the violating email message.

The following example describes how the Social Security content filter, one of the default filters, works:
The operand and the operator must be separated by a space.
For example, the following regular expression can match the social security number: .REG.
Any characters except space, control characters or the like
A single digit followed by a comma means there is no upper bound.
A single value inside the braces means that only that many occurrences will match.
Curly brace characters set a specific number of occurrences of the preceding element.
Square bracket characters indicate a set or a range of characters.
Parenthesis characters group whatever is between them to be considered as a single entity.
The question mark character means zero or one instances of the preceding element.
The plus sign character means one or more instances of the preceding element.
The asterisk character means zero or more instances of the preceding element.
do. matches doe, dog, don, dos, dot, etc.
The dot or period character represents any character except new line character.
When you are confident that the rule has no unexpected consequences, you can change your action.
Trend Micro recommends is to start with simple regular expressions that do not use complex syntax.

The IPv6 requirements for the Security Server are as follows:
Similar to an overlapping fragment attack, this Denial of Service attack deals with IP fragments.
This overwrites the header information in the first TCP fragment and may pass through a firewall.

IntelliTrap uses the following components when checking for bots and other malicious programs:
You can export the contents of the IntelliTrap log for inclusion in reports.
Agents write bot and other malware detections to the IntelliTrap log.
IntelliTrap uses the same scan engine as virus scanning.
Virus writers often attempt to circumvent virus/malware filtering by using different file compression schemes.
This covers virus/malware, worms, trojans, backdoors and bots.
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.
Because IntelliScan uses true file type identification, it only scans files that are vulnerable to infection.
IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.
There are several ways to run vulnerability scans.
Users must use an administrator account to log on to the client.
Vulnerability Scanner does not install the Security Agent on a client already running the Security Server.
The target client must not have Security Server installed.
The client should not be running Terminal Server.
You can launch Vulnerability Scanner on the Security Server or on any client in the network.
