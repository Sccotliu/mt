The following table describes the strings that match the example regular expression:
This expression matches with the social security number.
The following example describes how the Social Security content filter, one of the default filters, works:
The operand and the operator must be separated by a space.
For example, the following regular expression can match the social security number: .REG.
Any characters except space, control characters or the like
A single digit followed by a comma means there is no upper bound.
A single value inside the braces means that only that many occurrences will match.
Curly brace characters set a specific number of occurrences of the preceding element.
Square bracket characters indicate a set or a range of characters.
Parenthesis characters group whatever is between them to be considered as a single entity.
The question mark character means zero or one instances of the preceding element.
The plus sign character means one or more instances of the preceding element.
The asterisk character means zero or more instances of the preceding element.
do. matches doe, dog, don, dos, dot, etc.
The dot or period character represents any character except new line character.
When you are confident that the rule has no unexpected consequences, you can change your action.
Trend Micro recommends is to start with simple regular expressions that do not use complex syntax.
Poorly written regular expressions can have a dramatic negative performance impact.
Regular expressions are a powerful string matching tool.
One such site is the PerlDoc site, which can be found at:
There are a number of websites and tutorials available online.
See the following tables for some common examples of regular expressions.
Regular expressions are used to perform string matching.

IntelliTrap uses the following components when checking for bots and other malicious programs:
You can export the contents of the IntelliTrap log for inclusion in reports.
Agents write bot and other malware detections to the IntelliTrap log.
IntelliTrap uses the same scan engine as virus scanning.
Virus writers often attempt to circumvent virus/malware filtering by using different file compression schemes.
This covers virus/malware, worms, trojans, backdoors and bots.
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.
Because IntelliScan uses true file type identification, it only scans files that are vulnerable to infection.
IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.

Each time the Security Server completes an update, it automatically pushes the updates to agents.
Immediately after installation, the agents update from the Security Server.
The computer skill level of these individuals ranges from beginner to power user.
End users: Users who have the Security Agent installed on their computers.
These users are expected to have advanced networking and server management knowledge.
Using blocking is an effective way to control virus outbreaks.
Similarly, specific attacks are often associated with a specific file name.
Many virus/malware are closely associated with certain types of files.
The extension of an attachment identifies the file type, for example .txt, .exe, or .dll.
Attachment blocking prevents attachments in email messages from being delivered to the Microsoft Exchange Information Store.
It is also possible to create customized URL approval and blocking lists for specific groups.
Identify approved or blocked URLs in the Global Settings.
Check with QA to see if this info is correct.
Next to only one period and the first or last character of a string
You can only use a wildcard if it is:
The Messaging Security Agent does not support the wildcard match on the user name part.
The Messaging Security Agent supports wildcard matching for Approved and Blocked Senders lists.
The agent always categorizes email messages from blocked senders as spam and takes the appropriate action.
A Blocked Senders list is a list of suspect email addresses.
An Approved Senders list is a list of trusted email addresses.
When the spam score exceeds the detection level, the agent takes action against the spam.
The Security Server can download these components through a manual or scheduled update.
Trend Micro updates both the engine and pattern file frequently and makes them available for download.
An agent reports to the Security Server from which it was installed.
Protects desktops and servers from security threats and intrusions
Clients include desktops, servers, and Microsoft Exchange servers.
Each time you modify agent settings through the web console, the configuration files change.
Agents need the configuration files to apply new settings.
For details on the components that agents update, see .
Similarly, a pure IPv4 agent cannot obtain updates directly from a pure IPv6 Security Server/Update Agent.
For details on the update process, see .
Messaging Security Agents update only from the Security Server.
Security Agents update from the Security Server, Update Agents, or the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.

Trend Micro Recommended Scan Actions Against Viruses and Malware
The following table illustrates how ActiveAction handles each type of virus/malware.
You do not have to spend time configuring the scan actions.
ActiveAction uses scan actions that are recommended by Trend Micro.
Customizing scan actions requires knowledge about virus/malware and can be a tedious task.
Different types of virus/malware require different scan actions.
This chapter describes the features and capabilities of this product.
Security Agents use one of two scan methods when running scans:
Each scan has a different purpose and use, but all are configured approximately the same way.
You can customize these actions when you set up your scanning tasks.
