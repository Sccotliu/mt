Clean cannot be performed on probable virus/malware, but the scan action is configurable.
Probable viruses/malware are suspicious files that have some of the characteristics of viruses/malware.
They often do not alter system files or modify the boot sectors of hard disks.
Only some virus/malware types, such as worms, qualify as network viruses.
A virus spreading over a network is not, strictly speaking, a network virus.
A virus that resides on web pages and downloaded through a browser.
A virus encoded as an application macro and often included in a document.
An executable program with .com or .exe extension.
A virus that infects the boot sector of a partition or a disk.
Code that resides on web pages that execute ActiveX controls.
Trojan horse programs often use ports to gain access to computers or executable programs.
They use stealth to maintain a persistent and undetectable presence on the machine.
Compressing executables makes packers more difficult for antivirus products to detect.
Packers are compressed and/or encrypted Windows or Linux executable programs, often a Trojan horse program.
Others include viruses/malware not categorized under any of the other virus/malware types.
Tens of thousands of virus/malware exist, with more being created each day.

This efficient update method can substantially reduce bandwidth needed to update your antivirus software.
ActiveUpdate does not interrupt network services or require you to restart endpoints.
The resulting impact is leakage of confidential information in the form of identity loss.
One goal is to steal information for subsequent sale.
Web threats help these individuals pursue one of two goals.
For example, web threat creators constantly change the version or variant used.
Web threats encompass a broad array of threats that originate from the Internet.
Agents subject to web reputation policies use Web Reputation Services.
Web reputation then continues to scan sites and block users from accessing infected ones.
The Trend Micro Web Reputation Query system opens in a browser window.
To submit Web Reputation feedback, click the URL provided under Reassess URL.
Web Reputation does not perform any scanning on addresses located in the Approved and Blocked lists.

Endpoints must have an Internet connection to send queries successfully.
Agents send web reputation queries to the Smart Protection Network.
Smart Protection Servers do not store web reputation data for these websites.
Be sure to update Smart Protection Servers regularly so that protection remains current.
If all Smart Protection Servers are unavailable, agents do not send queries to Smart Protection Network.
Be sure that Smart Protection Servers are available.
By default, Web Reputation scans all traffic through all ports.
Web Reputation can monitor HTTPS traffic on the following browsers:
Enable checking of HTTPS URLs to reduce exposure to compromised and malicious sites that use HTTPS.
Compromised sites, even those with valid certificates, can host malware and steal personal information.
Although more secure, accessing websites using HTTPS still has risks.
It encrypts data to prevent theft and eavesdropping.
HTTPS communication uses certificates to identify web servers.
Before Web Reputation can check HTTPS URLs, you must configure some prerequisite settings for different browsers.

IntelliTrap uses the same scan engine as virus scanning.
Virus writers often attempt to circumvent virus/malware filtering by using different file compression schemes.
This covers virus/malware, worms, trojans, backdoors and bots.
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.
Because IntelliScan uses true file type identification, it only scans files that are vulnerable to infection.

All component updates originate from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
Otherwise, the server will be forced to download the full pattern file.
To take advantage of component duplication, be sure that the Security Server is updated regularly.
Trend Micro releases pattern files regularly to keep client protection current.
Obtain updates directly from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server or a pure IPv4 custom update source.

The Security Server automatically performs the following updates:
The server can be identified by its host name or IPv6 address.
If the server will manage only IPv6 agents, the minimum requirement is an IPv6 address.
The server must use an IIS web server.

The resulting impact is leakage of confidential information in the form of identity loss.
One goal is to steal information for subsequent sale.
Web threats help these individuals pursue one of two goals.
For example, web threat creators constantly change the version or variant used.
Web threats encompass a broad array of threats that originate from the Internet.
For upgrades, if Apache is currently used as web server:
Setup uses Apache if the Apache version is 2.0.54, 2.0.55, 2.0.6x, or 2.2.22.
For a fresh installation, Setup checks if a web server exists on the target computer.
Blocking access to untested pages can improve safety but can also prevent access to safe pages.
Highly suspicious: Suspected to be fraudulent or possible sources of threats
Dangerous: Verified to be fraudulent or known sources of threats

A virus encoded as an application macro and often included in a document.
An executable program with .com or .exe extension.
A virus that infects the boot sector of a partition or a disk.
Code that resides on web pages that execute ActiveX controls.
Trojan horse programs often use ports to gain access to computers or executable programs.
They use stealth to maintain a persistent and undetectable presence on the machine.
Compressing executables makes packers more difficult for antivirus products to detect.
Packers are compressed and/or encrypted Windows or Linux executable programs, often a Trojan horse program.
Others include viruses/malware not categorized under any of the other virus/malware types.
Others: Virus/Malware not categorized under any of the other virus/malware types.
Compressing executables makes packer more difficult for antivirus products to detect.
Packer: A compressed and/or encrypted Windows or Linux executable program, often a Trojan horse program.
