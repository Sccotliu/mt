About
This section introduces the product and the protection capabilities that defend the Mac computer from security threats.
About productname
provides the latest protection against security risks, blended threats, and platform independent web-based attacks.
Trend Micro software installed on a Macintosh computer (called "agent") reports its security status to, and obtains security settings and configurations from, the web-based  server.
The server is managed by a designated administrator in your organization.
The agent protects computers by scanning files and then performing a specific action for each security risk detected.
The agent also leverages the extensive web security databases from  to check the reputation of websites that you attempt to access, and block dangerous and unsafe websites.
About Security Risks
Security risk includes viruses, malware, spyware, and grayware.
productname protects endpoints from security risks by scanning files and then performing a specific action for each security risk detected.
An overwhelming number of security risks detected over a short period of time signals an outbreak, which productname can help contain by enforcing outbreak prevention policies and isolating infected endpoints until they are completely risk-free.
Notifications and logs help you keep track of security risks and alert you if you need to take immediate action.

Cache Settings for Scans
Each time scanning runs, the agent checks the modified files cache to see if a file has been modified since the last agent startup.
If a file has been modified, the agent scans the file and adds it to the scanned files cache.
If a file has not been modified, the agent checks if the file is in the scanned files cache.
If the file is in the scanned files cache, the agent skips scanning the file.
If the file is not in the scanned files cache, the agent checks the approved files cache.
The approved files cache contains files that productname deems trustworthy.
Trustworthy files have been scanned by successive versions of the pattern and declared threat-free each time, or threat-free files that have remained unmodified for an extended period of time.
If the file is in the approved files cache, the agent skips scanning the file.
If the file is not in the approved files cache, the agent scans the file and adds it to the scanned files cache.
All or some of the caches are cleared whenever the scan engine or pattern is updated.
If scans are run frequently and many files hit the caches, the scanning time reduces significantly.
If scans are seldom run, disable the caches so that files can be checked for threats with each scan.
Changing the Scan Method
Go to AgentsAgent Management.
In the agent tree, click the root icon () to include all agents or select specific groups or agents.
Click SettingsScan Methods.
Select Conventional scan or Smart scan.
If you selected group(s) or agent(s) in the agent tree, click Save.
If you clicked the root icon, choose from the following options:
Future groups are groups not yet created at the time you configured the settings.
This option will not apply settings to new agent added to an existing group.

Component Versions
Components
productname makes use of components to keep endpoints protected from the latest security risks.
Keep these components up-to-date by running manual or scheduled updates.
In addition to the components, productname agents also receive updated configuration files from the productname server.
Agents need the configuration files to apply new settings.
Each time you modify productname settings through the web console, the configuration files change.
Component
Agent Program
The productname agent program provides the actual protection from security risks.
Damage Cleanup Engine (64-bit)
The Damage Cleanup Engine scans for and removes Trojans and Trojan processes.
Damage Cleanup Template
The Damage Cleanup Template is used by the Damage Cleanup Engine to identify Trojan files and processes so the engine can eliminate them.
Smart Scan Agent Pattern
The pattern file that the agent uses to identify threats.
This pattern file is stored on the agent endpoint.
Spyware Active-monitoring Pattern
The Spyware Active-monitoring Pattern contains information that helps productname identify spyware and grayware.
Virus Scan Engine (32-bit/64-bit)
At the heart of all Trend Micro products lies the scan engine, which was originally developed in response to early file-based computer viruses.
The scan engine today is exceptionally sophisticated and capable of detecting different types of security risks, including spyware.
The scan engine also detects controlled viruses that are developed and used for research.
By storing the most time-sensitive information about security risks in the pattern files, Trend Micro minimizes the number of scan engine updates while keeping protection up-to-date.
Nevertheless, Trend Micro periodically makes new scan engine versions available.
Trend Micro releases new engines under the following circumstances:
Incorporation of new scanning and detection technologies into the software
Discovery of a new, potentially harmful security risk that the scan engine cannot handle
Enhancement of the scanning performance
Addition of file formats, scripting languages, encoding, and/or compression formats
Virus Pattern
The Virus Pattern contains information that helps productname identify the latest virus/malware and mixed threat attack.
Trend Micro creates and releases new versions of the Virus Pattern several times a week, and any time after the discovery of a particularly damaging virus/malware.
Configuring Administrator Notification Settings
When security risks are detected or when an outbreak occurs, productname administrators can receive notifications through email.
Navigate to NotificationsGeneral Settings.
In the SMTP server field, type either an IPv4/IPv6 address or endpoint name.
Type a port number between 1 and 65535.
Type the sender’s email address in the From field.
Configuring Agent Automatic Update
Automatic update relieves you of the burden of notifying all agents to update and eliminates the risk of agent computers not having up-to-date components.
In addition to components,  agents also receive updated configuration files during automatic update.
Each time you modify  settings through the web console, the configuration files change.
The  server can notify online agents to update components after it downloads the latest components, and offline agents when they restart and then connect to the server.
Optionally initiate Scan Now (manual scan) on  agent endpoints after the update.
Click UpdatesAgentsAgent Automatic Update.
Select the options.
Event-triggered Update
Option
Initiate component update on agents immediately after the server downloads a new component
The server notifies agents to update as soon as it completes an update.
Let agents initiate component update after restarting and connecting to the server
Any agent that missed an update immediately downloads components when it establishes connection with the server.
The agent may miss an update if it is offline or if the endpoint where it is installed is not up and running.
By default, update notifications are retained on the  server for up to seven days.
Offline agents will receive update notifications if the agents are online within the seven-day period.
Configuring Agent Self-protection
Navigate to Agent Management.
Click SettingsAgent Self-protection.
Select Protect files used by the agent.
If you selected group(s) or agent(s) on the agent tree, click Save to apply settings to the group(s) or agent(s).
If you selected the root icon (), choose from the following options:
Configuring Agent Update Settings conref
Configuring Agent Update Settings
Click SettingsUpdate Settings.
To set up scheduled updates, complete the following steps:
Select Enable scheduled update.
Configure the schedule.
If you select Daily or Weekly, specify the time of the update and the time period the Trend Micro Security (for Mac) server will notify agents to update components.
For example, if the start time is 12pm and the time period is 2 hours, the server randomly notifies all online agents to update components from 12pm until 2pm.
This setting prevents all online agents from simultaneously connecting to the server at the specified start time, significantly reducing the amount of traffic directed to the server.
Configuring Agent-Server Communication Settings
Agents identify the server that manages them by the server’s name or IPv4/IPv6 address.
During the productname server installation, the installer identifies the server computer’s IP addresses, which are then displayed on the web console’s Agent-Server Communication screen.
The server communicates with agents through the listening port, which is port number 61617 by default.
Notes and reminders:
If you change the port number, ensure that it is not currently in use to prevent conflicts with other applications and agent-server communication issues.
If a firewall application is in use on the server computer, ensure that the firewall does not block agent-server communication through the listening port.
For example, if the OfficeScan agent firewall has been enabled on the endpoint, add a policy exception that allows incoming and outgoing traffic through the listening port.
You can configure agents to connect to the server through a proxy server.
A proxy server, however, is usually not required for agent-server connections within the corporate network.
If you plan to update or replace all of the existing server names and IPv4/IPv6 addresses or change the listening port or proxy settings, do so before installing agents.
If you have installed agents and then make changes, agents will lose connection with the server and the only way to re-establish connection is to re-deploy the agents.
Navigate to AdministrationAgent-Server Communication.
Type the server’s name or IPv4/IPv6 address(es), and listening port.
If there are multiple entries in the Server name (or IP address) field, the agent randomly selects an entry.
Ensure that agent-server connection can be established using all the entries.
Select whether agents connect to the server through a proxy server.
Select the proxy server protocol.
Type the proxy server name or IPv4/IPv6 address, and port number.
If the proxy server requires authentication, type the user name and password in the fields provided.
If you are prompted to restart productname services for the settings to take effect, perform the following steps:
Navigate to the <Server installation folder>.
Double-click restart_TMSM.bat.
Wait until all the services have restarted.

Configuring Cache Settings for Scans
For details about the on-demand scan cache, see .
Click SettingsCache Settings for Scans.
Configuring IPv6 Addresses
The web console allows you to configure an IPv6 address or an IPv6 address range.
The following are some configuration guidelines.
productname accepts standard IPv6 address presentations.
2001:0db7:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
2001:db7:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
::ffff:192.0.2.128
productname also accepts link-local IPv6 addresses, such as:
fe80::210:5aff:feaa:20a2
Exercise caution when specifying a link-local IPv6 address because even though productname can accept the address, it might not work as expected under certain circumstances.
For example, agents cannot update from an update source if the source is on another network segment and is identified by its link-local IPv6 address.
When the IPv6 address is part of a URL, enclose the address in square brackets.
For IPv6 address ranges, a prefix and prefix length are usually required.

Configuring Web Reputation Settings conref
Web Reputation settings include policies that dictate whether Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will block or allow access to a website.
To determine the appropriate policy to use, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) checks the agent's location.
An agent's location is "internal" if it can connect to the Trend Micro Security (for Mac) server.
Otherwise, an agent's location is "external".
To configure a policy for external agents:
Click the External Agents tab.
Select Enable Web Reputation policy.
When the policy is enabled, external agents send web reputation queries to the Smart Protection Network.
Select from the available web reputation security levels: High, Medium or Low
The security levels determine whether Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will allow or block access to a URL.
For example, if you set the security level to Low, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) only blocks URLs that are known to be web threats.
As you set the security level higher, the web threat detection rate improves but the possibility of false positives also increases.
To submit web reputation feedback, click the URL provided.
The Trend Micro Web Reputation Query system opens in a browser window.
To configure a policy for internal agents:
Click the Internal Agents tab.
When the policy is enabled, internal agents send web reputation queries to:
Smart Protection Servers if the Send queries to Smart Protection Servers option is enabled.
Smart Protection Network if the Send queries to Smart Protection Servers option is disabled.
Select Send queries to Smart Protection Servers if you want internal agents to send web reputation queries to Smart Protection Servers.
If you enable this option, agents refer to the same smart protection source list used by OfficeScan agents to determine the Smart Protection Servers to which they send queries.
If you disable this option, agents send web reputation queries to Smart Protection Network.
Endpoints must have Internet connection to send queries successfully.
Agents do not block untested websites, regardless of the security level.
Select whether to allow the agents to send web reputation logs to the server.
Allow agents to send logs if you want to analyze URLs being blocked by Trend Micro Security (for Mac) and take the appropriate action on URLs you think are safe to access.

If you use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, use the correct proxy settings to download updates successfully.
conref - Switching Scan Types
If you are switching agents from conventional scan to smart scan, ensure that you have set up Smart Protection Services on the OfficeScan server.
For details, see the OfficeScan documentation.
The following table provides other considerations when switching agents to smart scan.
Considerations When Switching to Smart Scan
Consideration
Product license
To use smart scan, ensure that you have activated the licenses for the following services on the OfficeScan server and that the licenses are not expired:
Antivirus
Web Reputation and Anti-spyware
server
Ensure that agents can connect to the  server.
Only online agents will be notified to switch to smart scan.
Offline agents get notified when they become online.
Roaming agents are notified when they become online or, if the agent has scheduled update privileges, when scheduled update runs.
Number of agents to switch
Switching a relatively small number of agents at a time allows efficient use of  server resources.
The  server can perform other critical tasks while agents change their scan methods.
When switching to smart scan for the first time, agents need to download the full version of the Smart Scan Agent Pattern from the  server.
The Smart Scan Pattern is only used by smart scan agents.
Timing
Consider switching during off-peak hours to ensure the download process finishes within a short amount of time.
Also consider switching when no agent is scheduled to update from the server.
Agent tree settings
Scan method is a granular setting that can be set on the root, group, or individual agent level.
When switching to smart scan, you can:
Create a new group and assign smart scan as its scan method.
Any agent you move to this group will use smart scan.
When you move the agent, enable the setting Apply settings of new group to selected agent(s).
Select a group and configure it to use smart scan.
Conventional scan agents belonging to the group will switch to smart scan.
Select one or several conventional scan agents from a group and then switch them to smart scan.
Any changes to the group's scan method overrides the scan method you have configured for individual agents.
IPv6 support
Smart scan agents send scan queries to smart protection sources.
A pure IPv6 smart scan agent cannot send queries directly to pure IPv4 sources, such as:
Smart Protection Server 3.0 (integrated or standalone)
IPv6 support for Smart Protection Server starts in version 2.5.
Trend Micro Smart Protection Network
Similarly, a pure IPv4 smart scan agent cannot send queries to pure IPv6 Smart Protection Servers.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow smart scan agents to connect to the sources.

Moving an Agent to Another Server
Smart Feedback
For details about moving agents, see .
A group in productname is a set of agents that share the same configuration and run the same tasks.
By organizing agents into groups, you can simultaneously configure, manage, and apply the same configuration to all agents belonging to the groups.
For ease of management, group agents based on their departments or the functions they perform.
You can also group agents that are at a greater risk of infection to apply a more secure configuration to all of them.
You can add or rename groups, move agents to a different group, move agents to another server, or remove agents permanently.
An agent removed from the agent tree is not automatically uninstalled from the endpoint.
The agent can still perform server-dependent tasks, such as updating components.
However, the server is unaware of the existence of the agent and therefore cannot send configurations or notifications to the agent.
If the agent has been uninstalled from the endpoint, it is not automatically removed from the agent tree and its connection status is "Offline".
Manually remove the agent from the agent tree.
Inactive Agents
productname displays agents as inactive:
If you use the agent uninstallation program to remove the agent program from the endpoints but do not unregister the agent from the server.
If you reformatted the endoint hard drive without unregistering the agent from the server.
If you manually removed the agent files.
If a user unloads or disables the agent for an extended period of time.
To have the agent tree display active agents only, configure productname to automatically remove inactive agents from the agent tree.
Initiating Scan Now
All the Scheduled Scan settings, except the actual schedule, are used during Scan Now.
To configure settings before initiating Scan Now, follow the steps in .
All the Scheduled Scan settings in policies, except the actual schedule, are used during Scan Now.

Instruct users to allow the connection when prompted.
Check for and uninstall any security software on the endpoint.
Obtain the agent installation package tmsminstall.zip.
Copy tmsminstall.zip on the endpoint and then launch it using a built-in archiving tool, such as Archive Utility.
The files on tmsminstall.zip may become corrupted if users launch it using archiving tools not built-in on the Mac.
To launch tmsminstall.zip from Terminal, use the following command:
ditto –xk
Launching tmsminstall.zip creates a new folder tmsminstall.
Open the tmsminstall folder and launch tmsminstall.pkg.
When a message prompting you to continue with installation displays, click Continue.
On the Introduction screen, click Continue to proceed.
Read the reminders and click Continue.
On the Installation Type screen, click Install.
Fill in the Name and Password fields to begin the installation process.
If the installation was successful, click Close to finish the installation process.
The agent automatically registers to the server where the agent installation package was obtained.
The agent also updates for the first time.

Installing on Several Endpoints conref
The process of installing productname agent on several endpoints can be simplified by using Apple Remote Desktop.
Obtain the agent installation package tmsminstall.mpkg.zip.
Copy tmsminstall.mpkg.zip on the endpoint with Apple Remote Desktop and then launch it using a built-in archiving tool, such as Archive Utility.
The files on tmsminstall.mpkg.zip may become corrupted if users launch it using archiving tools not built-in on the Mac.
To launch tmsminstall.mpkg.zip from Terminal, use the following command:
ditto –xk
Launching tmsminstall.mpkg.zip extracts the file tmsminstall.mpkg.
Open Apple Remote Desktop on the endpoint.
Select the endpoints to which to install the productname agent and then click Install.
On the Install Packages screen, drag the installation package or click "+" to locate the installation package.
(Optional) Click Save to automatically run the installation task on new endpoints that connect to the network.
Click Install.
The Apple Remote Desktop starts installing the agent to the selected endpoints.
If the installation was successful on all endpoints, the message Install Packages: Succeeded on all appears.
Otherwise, Successful appears under Task Status for each endpoint on which the installation was successful.

IntelliScan
IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.
For executable files (for example, .exe), the true file type is determined based on the file content.
For non-executable files (for example, .txt), the true file type is determined based on the file header.
Using IntelliScan provides the following benefits:
Performance optimization: IntelliScan does not affect applications on the endpoint because it uses minimal system resources.
Shorter scanning period: Because IntelliScan uses true file type identification, it only scans files that are vulnerable to infection.
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.

Microsoft SQL server support
supports the following SQL servers for data storage:
Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Express
Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 Express
Feature/Enhancement
Smart Scan
uses smart scan to make the scanning process more efficient.
This technology works by off-loading a large number of signatures previously stored on the local endpoint to Smart Protection Sources.
Using this approach, the system and network impact of the ever-increasing volume of signature updates to endpoint systems is significantly reduced.
Enhanced  agent security prevents users without administrator privileges from accessing the agent log directory on endpoints.
agent interface redesign
The  agent interface has been redesigned to provide an easier, more streamlined, and more modern experience.
All the features available in the previous  client version are still available in the updated version.
Scan monitoring
provides more visibility and control over scan features through:
Security risk log filtering by scan actions on the agent console.
Virus/malware count reset for selected agents or agent groups.
Scan Operation logs: Monitor scan time, scan status, and scan results using the web console and the agent console.
Agent self-protection
The productname agent implements the following self-protection features:
Prevents the removal or modification of  agent program files and folders
Prevents the blocking of  agent processes
Restricts access to the agent log directory on endpoints to users with administrator privileges
Damage Cleanup Services
Damage Cleanup Services
cleans computers of file-based and network viruses, and virus and worm remnants (Trojans, viral files) through a fully-automated process.
To address the threats and nuisances posed by
Trojan horse program
Trojans, Damage Cleanup Services does the following:
Detects and removes live Trojans
Kills processes that Trojans create
Repairs system files that Trojans modify
Deletes files and applications that Trojans drop
Because Damage Cleanup Services runs automatically in the background, it is not necessary to configure it.
Users are not even aware when it runs.
However,  may sometimes notify users to restart their endpoints to complete the process of removing a Trojan.
Centralized Management
A web-based management console gives administrators transparent access to all agents on the network.
The web console coordinates automatic deployment of security policies, pattern files, and software updates on every agent.
Administrators can perform remote administration and configure settings for individual agents or agent groups.

AKA This Product
productname Agent IPv6 Requirements
All Mac OS X versions supported by the productname agent also support IPv6.
It is preferable for the agent to have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as some of the entities to which it connects only support IPv4 addressing.
productname Server IPv6 Requirements
productname server must be installed with an OfficeScan server version that supports IPv6.
IPv6 support in OfficeScan started in version 10.6.
Earlier OfficeScan versions that are compatible with productname (see ) do not support IPv6 addressing.
See the OfficeScan 10.6 or later documentation for details about IPv6 support.

limitations
The following table lists the limitations when agents only have an IPv6 address.
Item
Limitation
Pure IPv6 agents cannot be managed by a pure IPv4 server.
Updates
A pure IPv6 agent cannot update from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
Trend Micro ActiveUpdate Server
A pure IPv4 Trend Micro Security (for Mac) server
Web Reputation queries
A pure IPv6 agent cannot send Web Reputation queries to Trend Micro Smart Protection Network.
Proxy connection
A pure IPv6 agent cannot connect through a pure IPv4 proxy server.
Agent deployment
Apple Remote Desktop is unable to deploy the agent to pure IPv6 endpoints because these endpoints always appear as offline.
Most of these limitations can be overcome by setting up a dual-stack proxy server that can convert between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (such as DeleGate).
Position the proxy server between the agents and the entities to which they connect.
Pure IPv6 Server Limitations Conref
The following table lists the limitations when the productname server only has an IPv6 address.
Agent management
A pure IPv6 server cannot manage pure IPv4 agents.
Updates and centralized management
A pure IPv6 server cannot update from pure IPv4 update sources or report to pure IPv4 central management products, such as:
Any pure IPv4 custom update source
Product registration, activation, and renewal
A pure IPv6 server cannot connect to the Trend Micro Online Registration Server to register the product, obtain the license, and activate/renew the license.
A pure IPv6 server cannot connect through a pure IPv4 proxy server.
Position the proxy server between the productname server and the entities to which it connects or the entities that it serves.
Pure IPv4 Control Manager 6.0
Real-time Scan is a persistent and ongoing scan.
Each time a file is received, opened, downloaded, copied, or modified, Real-time Scan scans the file for security risks.
If productname does not detect a security risk, the file remains in its location and users can proceed to access the file.
If productname detects a security risk, it displays a notification message, showing the name of the infected file and the specific security risk.
Configure and apply Real-time Scan settings to one or several agents and groups, or to all agents that the server manages.
In the agent tree, select the group to rename.
Click Manage Agent TreeRename Group.
Type a new name for the group.
Click Rename.
The new group name appears in the agent tree.
Resetting Security Risk Count
You can go to the Reset Statistics screen to reset the detection count for security risks back to zero.
Click LogsReset Statistics.
The Security Risk field displays the total detection count for the selected agents, all agents in the selected groups, or all agents.
Click Reset.
Prepare the backup of the database files created during backup.
Search for db_TMSM and then use the detach option in SQL Server Management Studio to detach the current database files.
Use the attach option to attach the backup of the database files.
Running a Manual Scan conref
Manual Scan is an on-demand scan and starts immediately after you launch it from the agent console.
Manual Scan checks for security risks and also eradicates old infections to minimize reinfection.
The scanning duration depends on the computer's hardware resources and the number of files to scan.
During a Manual Scan, the agent performs a specific action against detected security risks.
The action is configured by the productname administrator.
Open the main console.
Quick Scan: Scans areas of the endpoint typically targeted by security risks.
The pattern files on the agent contain information on the endpoint areas to scan.
Custom Scan: Scans the files or folders of your choice.
Run custom scan on files or folders that you suspect to be infected.
Full Scan: Scans all files, except encrypted and password-protected files.
Wait for the scan to finish and check the results.
You can stop or pause scanning while it is in progress.
Click Scan and choose one of the following scan options:
The  agent receives updates automatically from the  server.
You can update manually if you have been disconnected from the office network for a while or if there is an urgent need to obtain the latest protection from security threats (for example, after an outbreak).
If you use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, ensure you have the correct proxy settings.
Open the main console and click Update.
Click OK when the update is complete.
Scan Action Options and Additional Settings
When configuring the scan action, select from the following options:
Use ActiveAction
ActiveAction is a set of pre-configured scan actions for different types of security risks.
If you are unsure which scan action is suitable for a certain type of security risk, Trend Micro recommends using ActiveAction.
ActiveAction settings are constantly updated in the pattern files to protect endpoints against the latest security risks and the latest methods of attacks.
Use the same action for all security risk types
Select this option if you want the same action performed on all types of security risks, except probable virus/malware.
For Probable Virus/Malware, the action is always "Pass".
If you choose "Clean" as the first action, select a second action that Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs if cleaning is unsuccessful.
If the first action is not "Clean", no second action is configurable.
For details about scan actions, see .
Additional Real-time Scan Settings
Setting
Display a notification message when a security risk is detected
When Trend Micro Security (for Mac) detects a security risk during Real-time Scan, it can display a notification message to inform the user about the detection.
Scheduled Scan Privileges
If Scheduled Scan is enabled on the endpoint, users can postpone and skip/stop Scheduled Scan.
Privilege
Postpone Scheduled Scan
Users with the "Postpone Scheduled Scan" privilege can perform the following actions:
Postpone Scheduled Scan before it runs and then specify the postpone duration.
Scheduled Scan can only be postponed once.
If Scheduled Scan is in progress, users can stop scanning and restart it later.
Users then specify the amount of time that should elapse before scanning restarts.
When scanning restarts, all previously scanned files are scanned again.
Scheduled Scan can be stopped and then restarted only once.
Configure the number of hours and minutes, which corresponds to:
The maximum postpone duration
The maximum amount of time that should elapse before scanning restarts
Skip and Stop Scheduled Scan
This privilege allows users to perform the following actions:
Skip Scheduled Scan before it runs
Stop Scheduled Scan when it is in progress
Additional Scheduled Scan Settings
Display a notification before Scheduled Scan runs
When you enable this option, a notification message displays on the endpoint several minutes before Scheduled Scan runs.
Users are notified of the scan schedule (date and time) and their Scheduled Scan privileges, such as postponing, skipping, or stopping Scheduled Scan.
Configure the timing for displaying the notification message, in number of minutes.
Automatically stop Scheduled Scan when scanning lasts more than __ hours and __ minutes
The agent stops scanning when the specified amount of time is exceeded and scanning is not yet complete.
The agent immediately notifies users of any security risk detected during scanning.
Specify the action Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs when a particular scan type detects a security risk.
The action Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs depends on the scan type that detected the security risk.
For example, when Trend Micro Security (for Mac) detects a security risk during Manual Scan (scan type), it cleans (action) the infected file.
The following are the actions Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can perform against security risks:
Scan Action
Delete
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) removes the infected file from the endpoint.
Quarantine
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) renames and then moves the infected file to the quarantine directory on the endpoint located in /common/lib/vsapi/quarantine.
Once in the quarantine directory, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can perform another action on the quarantined file, depending on the action specified by the user.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can delete, clean, or restore the file.
Restoring a file means moving it back to its original location without performing any action.
Users may restore the file if it is actually harmless.
Cleaning a file means removing the security risk from the quarantined file and then moving it to its original location if cleaning is successful.
Clean
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) removes the security risk from an infected file before allowing users to access it.
If the file is uncleanable, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs a second action, which can be one of the following actions: Quarantine, Delete, and Pass.
To configure the second action, navigate to Agent ManagementSettings{Scan Type} and click the Action tab.
Pass
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs no action on the infected file but records the detected security risk in the logs.
The file stays where it is located.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) always performs "Pass" on files infected with the Probable Virus/Malware type to mitigate a False Positive.
If further analysis confirms that probable virus/malware is indeed a security risk, a new pattern will be released to allow Trend Micro Security (for Mac) to perform the appropriate scan action.
If actually harmless, probable virus/malware will no longer be detected.
For example: Trend Micro Security (for Mac) detects "x_probable_virus" on a file named "123.pdf" and performs no action at the time of detection.
Trend Micro then confirms that "x_probable_virus" is a Trojan horse program and releases a new Virus Pattern version.
After loading the new pattern, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will detect "x_probable_virus" as a Trojan program and, if the action against such programs is "Delete", will delete "123.pdf".
Specify which files a particular scan type should scan using file attributes such as file type and extension.
Also specify conditions that will trigger scanning.
For example, configure Real-time Scan to scan each file after it is downloaded to the endpoint.
Configure scan exclusions to increase the scanning performance and skip scanning files that are known to be harmless.
When a particular scan type runs, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) checks the scan exclusion list to determine which files on the endpoint will be excluded from scanning.
Scan Exclusion List
Files
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will not scan a file if:
The file is located under the directory path specified in the scan exclusion list
The file matches the full file path (directory path and file name) specified in the scan exclusion list
File extensions
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will not scan a file if its file extension matches any of the extensions included in this exclusion list.

Available starting in  3.0.
Scanning behavior
The conventional scan agent performs scanning on the local endpoint.
The smart scan agent performs scanning on the local endpoint.
If the agent cannot determine the risk of the file during the scan, the agent verifies the risk by sending a scan query to a smart protection source.
The agent "caches" the scan query result to improve the scan performance.
Components in use and updated

Scan Methods - Conref
agents can use one of two scan methods when scanning for security risks.
The scan methods are smart scan and conventional scan.
Smart Scan
Agents that use smart scan are referred to as smart scan agents in this document.
Smart scan agents benefit from local scans and in-the-cloud queries provided by File Reputation Services.
Conventional Scan
Agents that do not use smart scan are called conventional scan agents.
A conventional scan agent stores all  components on the agent endpoint and scans all files locally.
Scan Now is initiated remotely by a productname administrator through the web console and can be run on one or several endpoints.
Initiate Scan Now on endpoints that you suspect to be infected.
The  agent is not always able to perform a desired action on detected threats.
When this happens one of the following scan results will appear.
Unable to clean the file
The file may be uncleanable.
For details and solutions, see .
Unable to delete the file

Spyware and grayware refer to applications or files not classified as viruses or malware, but can still negatively affect the performance of the endpoints on the network.
Spyware and grayware introduce significant security, confidentiality, and legal risks to an organization.
Spyware/Grayware often performs a variety of undesired and threatening actions such as irritating users with pop-up windows, logging user keystrokes, and exposing endpoint vulnerabilities to attack.
productname protects endpoints from the following spyware/grayware types:
Spyware/Grayware Types
Spyware
Spyware gathers data, such as account user names, passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential information, and transmits it to third parties.
Adware
Adware displays advertisements and gathers data, such as web surfing preferences, used for targeting future advertising at the user.
Dialer
A dialer changes client Internet settings and can force an endpoint to dial pre-configured phone numbers through a modem.
These are often pay-per-call or international numbers that can result in a significant expense for an organization.
Hacking tool
A hacking tool helps hackers enter an endpoint.
Remote access tool
A remote access tool helps hackers remotely access and control an endpoint.
Password cracking application
This type of application helps decipher account user names and passwords.
"Others" include potentially malicious programs not categorized under any of the spyware/grayware types.
For a list of scan results, see .
For agent upgrade instructions, see .
Upgrade agents to the latest program version or build if a new version is available.
Switching from Conventional Scan to Smart Scan
Also verify that the  server has the latest components because smart scan agents need to download the Smart Scan Agent Pattern from the server.
To update components, see .
Switching from Smart Scan to Conventional Scan
switching from conventional scan
switching to smart scan
The following table provides other considerations when switching agents to conventional scan.
Considerations When Switching to Conventional Scan
Switching a relatively small number of agents at a time allows efficient use of the  server and Smart Protection Server resources.
These servers can perform other critical tasks while agents change their scan methods.
When switching back to conventional scan, agents will likely download the full version of the Virus Pattern and Spyware-active Monitoring Pattern from the  server.
These pattern files are only used by conventional scan agents.
Scan method is a granular setting that can be set on the root, domain, or individual agent level.
When switching to conventional scan, you can:
Create a new group and assign conventional scan as its scan method.
Any agent you move to this group will use conventional scan.
Select a group and configure it to use conventional scan.
Smart scan agents belonging to the group will switch to conventional scan.
Select one or several smart scan agents from a group and then switch them to conventional scan.
OfficeScan server
10.6 SP2 or later
2.0 and higher
1.5GB minimum if the OfficeScan server is installed on the system drive (usually, C: drive)
If the OfficeScan server is not installed on the system drive:
600MB minimum on the drive where the OfficeScan server is installed.
The productname server will be installed on this drive.

Dual-stack
An entity that has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
A dual-stack endpoint is an endpoint with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
A dual-stack agent refers to an agent installed on a dual-stack endpoint.
A dual-stack proxy server, such as DeleGate, can convert between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
Pure IPv4
An entity that only has an IPv4 address
The productname agent tree displays all the agents that the server currently manages.
All agents belong to a certain group.
Use the menu items above the agent tree to simultaneously configure, manage, and apply the same configuration to all agents belonging to a group.
The productname Agent
Protect endpoints from security risks by installing the productname agent on each endpoint.
The agent provides three scan types:
The agent reports to the parent productname server from which it was installed.
The agent sends events and status information to the server in real time.
Agents communicate with the server through the ActiveMQ protocol.
The productname Server
The productname server is the central repository for all agent configurations, security risk logs, and updates.
The server performs two important functions:
Monitors and manages productname agents
Downloads components needed by agents.
By default, the productname server downloads components from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server and then distributes them to agents
How the productname server works
productname provides real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and agents.
Manage the agents from a browser-based web console, which you can access from virtually anywhere on the network.
The server communicates with the agent through the ActiveMQ protocol.

Troubleshooting Resources
Before contacting technical support, consider visiting the following Trend Micro online resources.
Scan Result
Cleaned
Deleted
An infected file was removed from the system.
Passed
No action was performed on the detected file because the file is suspicious but unverified.
Trend Micro will reexamine the file to determine the appropriate action to perform.
Quarantined
A detected file is quarantined and cannot be executed because the file is suspicious.
The Virus Scan Engine is unable to clean the following files:
Uncleanable File
Explanation and Solution
Files infected with worms
A computer worm is a self-contained program (or set of programs) able to spread functional copies of itself or its segments to other endpoint systems.
The propagation usually takes place through network connections or email attachments.
Worms are uncleanable because the file is a self-contained program.
Solution: Trend Micro recommends deleting worms.
Write-protected infected files
Solution: Remove the write-protection to allow the productname agent to clean the file.
Password-protected files
Includes password-protected files or compressed files.
Solution: Remove the password protection for the productname agent to clean these files.
Backup files
Files with the RB0~RB9 extensions are backup copies of infected files.
The productname agent creates a backup of the infected file in case the virus/malware damaged the file during the cleaning process.
Solution: If the productname agent successfully cleans the infected file, you do not need to keep the backup copy.
If the endpoint functions normally, you can delete the backup file.
Open the OfficeScan web console and click Plug-ins on the main menu.
Uninstalling the productname Server conref
Uninstalling the productname Server
Go to the productname section and click Uninstall.
Monitor the uninstallation progress.

Tens of thousands of virus/malware exist, with more being created each day.
Endpoint viruses today can cause a great amount of damage by exploiting vulnerabilities in corporate networks, email systems and websites.
productname protects endpoints from the following virus/malware types:
Virus/Malware Types
Joke program
A joke program is a virus-like program that often manipulates the appearance of things on an endpoint monitor.
A Trojan horse is an executable program that does not replicate but instead resides on endpoints to perform malicious acts, such as opening ports for hackers to enter.
This program often uses Trojan ports to gain access to endpoints.
An application that claims to rid an endpoint of viruses when it actually introduces viruses to the endpoint is an example of a Trojan program.
Virus
A virus is a program that replicates.
To do so, the virus needs to attach itself to other program files and execute whenever the host program executes.
Boot sector virus: A virus that infects the boot sector of a partition or a disk
Java malicious code: Operating system-independent virus code written or embedded in Java
Macro virus: A virus encoded as an application macro and often included in a document
VBScript, JavaScript, or HTML virus: A virus that resides on web pages and downloads through a browser
Worm: A self-contained program or set of programs able to spread functional copies of itself or its segments to other endpoints, often through email
Test virus
A test virus is an inert file that is detectable by virus scanning software.
Use test viruses, such as the EICAR test script, to verify that the antivirus installation scans properly.
Packer
Packers are compressed and/or encrypted Windows or Linux executable programs, often a Trojan horse program.
Compressing executables makes packers more difficult for antivirus products to detect.
Probable virus/malware
Suspicious files that have some of the characteristics of virus/malware are categorized under this virus/malware type.
For details about probable virus/malware, see the following page on the Trend Micro online Virus Encyclopedia:
http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/
"Others" include viruses/malware not categorized under any of the virus/malware types.
Web Console Access conref
The web console cannot be accessed.
Check if the endpoint meets the requirements for installing and running productname server.
Check if the following services have been started:
OfficeScan Plug-in Manager
Collect debug logs.
Use 'error' or 'fail' as keyword when performing a search on the logs.
Installation logs: C:\TMSM*.log
General debug logs: <Server installation folder>\debug.log

Delete the ActiveMQ data.
Try to restart the productname service by double-clicking restart_TMSM.bat.
Try to access the web console again to check if the access problem has been resolved.
Verify that you have typed the correct user name and password.
Contact your service providor if the problem persists.
Web Reputation Services
Query the safety rating and content type of a URL suspected of being a phishing site, or other so-called "disease vector" (the intentional source of Internet threats such as spyware and malware):
If the assigned rating is incorrect, send a re-classification request to Trend Micro.
web reputation
Web reputation technology tracks the credibility of web domains by assigning a reputation score based on factors such as a website's age, historical location changes, and indications of suspicious activities discovered through malware behavior analysis.
It will then continue to scan sites and block users from accessing infected ones.
Agents send queries to smart protection sources to determine the reputation of websites that users are attempting to access.
A website’s reputation is correlated with the specific web reputation policy enforced on the endpoint.
Depending on the policy in use, the agent will either block or allow access to the website.
This feature supports the latest Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome browsers released as of April 2014.
Web Threats
web threats
Web threats encompass a broad array of threats that originate from the Internet.
Web threats are sophisticated in their methods, using a combination of various files and techniques rather than a single file or approach.
For example, web threat creators constantly change the version or variant used.
Because the web threat is in a fixed location of a website rather than on an infected endpoint, the web threat creator constantly modifies its code to avoid detection.
In recent years, individuals once characterized as hackers, virus writers, spammers, and spyware makers have become known as cyber criminals.
Web threats help these individuals pursue one of two goals.
One goal is to steal information for subsequent sale.
The resulting impact is leakage of confidential information in the form of identity loss.
The infected endpoint may also become a vector to deliver phish attacks or other information capturing activities.
Among other impacts, this threat has the potential to erode confidence in web commerce, corrupting the trust needed for Internet transactions.
The second goal is to hijack a user’s CPU power to use it as an instrument to conduct profitable activities.
Activities include sending spam or conducting extortion in the form of distributed denial-of-service attacks or pay-per-click activities.
Manage productname widgets on the OfficeScan dashboard.
The widgets are available after activating productname.
To view widgets, be sure that the OfficeScan version is 10.6 SP2 or later and the Plug-in Manager version is 1.5 or later.
For details on working with widgets, see the OfficeScan documentation.
Working with Quarantined Files conref
When the action on a security risk is "quarantine", the agent renames and then moves the infected file to the quarantine directory on your computer.
Actions on security risks are configured by the productname administrator.
Once in the quarantine directory, the agent can perform further action on the quarantined file, depending on the action you choose on the Quarantined Files screen.
Click View Quarantined Files.
Choose from the following actions:
Restore: Moves the file back to its original location.
Choose this action if you think a file has been incorrectly detected as infected.
Delete: Removes the infected file permanently from the computer.
Clean: Removes the security risk from the file and then moves the file back to its original location.
On the main console, click the log icon or the Virus/Malware count to display the Logs screen.
The action buttons become active.
The  agent main console contains information related to the system's status, scan schedule, virus pattern, and update schedule.
It also serves as the central location for performing scans, running updates, and configuring settings.

7. Known Issues
7. Known Issues
The following are the known
issues in this release:
Trend Micro Security Server
When the server is installed on       a Windows Server 2008 computer, the following Windows message displays:
A program can't display a message on your  desktop.
This message can be ignored.
The server will be installed successfully.
A client that has been       uninstalled from a Macintosh computer is not automatically unregistered from       the server.
On the Web console's client tree, the client's status is       "offline".
On the Web console's client tree, the client's status is       offline.
To unregister the client from the server:
On the Web console, click        Client Management and select the client that was uninstalled.
Click Manage Client Tree >        Remove Group/Client.
The server does not       automatically remove inactive clients from the client tree.
An inactive client has been continuously offline for an  extended period of time and may have already been uninstalled from the  Macintosh computer.
To remove an inactive client, see the unregistration steps  in known issue 7.1.2.
Trend Micro Security Client
Trend Micro Security client does       not support the ipfw (ipfirewall) command.
When a user issues the command on the Macintosh computer to limit       bandwidth usage, the computer becomes unresponsive.
When a user uses proxy settings for Internet connection and then accesses a Web site that does not exist, the Trend Micro Security client displays a blocking page stating that the Web site is unrated.
If users choose the option Set       access for specific services and applications in the personal firewall for       Mac OS X and then install the Trend Micro Security client, users need to       allow connections to icorepluginMgr when prompted by the system.       icorepluginMgr is used to register the client to the server.
A Java-based application on       Macintosh computers may take longer to launch if the application links to       a large number of .jar files.
Trend Micro Security needs to scan all the       .jar files for security risks before the application can be launched.
If       users experience this problem, you can consider adding .jar to the scan       exclusion list.

Protecting Computers from Web-based Threats
Topics in this chapter:
About_Web_Threats
About Web Threats
Web threats encompass a broad array of threats that originate from the Internet.
Web threats are sophisticated in their methods, using a combination of various files and techniques rather than a single file or approach.
For example, Web threat creators constantly change the version or variant used.
Because the Web threat is in a fixed location of a Web site rather than on an infected computer, the Web threat creator constantly modifies its code to avoid detection.
Web threats
about
In recent years, individuals once characterized as hackers, virus writers, spammers, and spyware makers are now known as cyber criminals.
Web threats help these individuals pursue one of two goals.
One goal is to steal information for subsequent sale.
The resulting impact is leakage of confidential information in the form of identity loss.
The infected computer may also become a vector to deliver  or other information capturing activities.
Among other impacts, this threat has the potential to erode confidence in Web commerce, corrupting the trust needed for Internet transactions.
The second goal is to hijack a user’s CPU power to use it as an instrument to conduct profitable activities.
Activities include sending spam or conducting extortion in the form of distributed denial-of-service attacks or pay-per-click activities.

Web_Reputation
Web Reputation
Trend Micro Security leverages Trend Micro’s extensive Web security databases to check the reputation of Web sites that users are attempting to access.
The Web site’s reputation is correlated with the specific Web reputation policy enforced on the computer.
Depending on the policy in use, Trend Micro Security will either block or allow access to the Web site.
Policies are enforced based on the client’s location.
Web reputation
Web_Reputation_Policies
Web Reputation Policies
Web reputation policies dictate whether Trend Micro Security will block or allow access to a Web site.
To determine the appropriate policy to use, Trend Micro Security checks the client's location.
A client's location is "internal" if it can connect to the Trend Micro Security server.
Otherwise, a client's location is "external".
policies
To configure a Web reputation policy:
Client Management  Settings  Web Reputation Settings
Configure a policy for External Clients and Internal Clients.
Select the check box to enable the Web reputation policy.
Select from the available Web reputation security levels:
High, Medium, or Low
The security levels determine whether Trend Micro Security will allow or block access to a URL.
For example, if you set the security level to Low, Trend Micro Security only blocks URLs that are known to be Web threats.
As you set the security level higher, the Web threat detection rate improves but the possibility of false positives also increases.
For internal clients, select whether to allow the Trend Micro Security client to send  to the server.
Allow clients to send logs if you want to analyze URLs being blocked by Trend Micro Security and take the appropriate action on URLs you think are safe to access.
If you selected group(s) or client(s) on the client tree, click Save to apply settings to the group(s) or client(s).
If you selected the root icon , choose from the following options:
Apply to All Clients:
Applies settings to all existing clients and to any new client added to an existing/future group.
Future groups are groups not yet created at the time you configure the settings.
Apply to Future Groups Only:
Applies settings only to clients added to future groups.
This option will not apply settings to new clients added to an existing group.
Approved_URLs
Approved URLs
Approved URLs bypass Web Reputation policies.
Trend Micro Security does not block these URLs even if the Web Reputation policy is set to block them.
Add URLs that you consider safe to the approved URL list.
To configure the approved URL list:
Administration  Web Reputation Approved URL List
Specify a URL in the text box.
You can add a wildcard character (*) anywhere on the URL.
Examples:
www.trendmicro.com/* means that all pages under www.trendmicro.com will be approved.
*.trendmicro.com/* means that all pages on any sub-domain of trendmicro.com will be approved.
Click Add.
To delete an entry, click the icon next to an approved URL.
Click Save.
Web_Reputation_Logs
Web Reputation Logs
Configure internal clients to send Web reputation logs to the server.
Do this if you want to analyze URLs that Trend Micro Security blocks and take appropriate action on URLs you think are safe to access.
logs
To keep the size of logs from occupying too much space on the hard disk, manually delete logs or configure a log deletion schedule.
For more information about managing logs, see .
To view Web reputation logs:
Client Management  Logs  Web Reputation Logs
Specify the log criteria and click Display Logs.
View logs.
Logs contain the following information:
Date/Time Trend Micro Security blocked the URL
Computer where the user accessed the URL
Blocked URL
URL's risk level
Link to the Trend Micro Web Reputation Query system that provides more information about the blocked URL
To save logs to a comma-separated value (CSV) file, click Export.
Open the file or save it to a specific location.
If you are exporting a large number of logs, wait for the export task to finish.
If you close the page before the export task is finished, the .csv file will not be generated.

Client-Server_Communication
Client-Server Communication
client-server communication
Clients identify the server that manages them by the server’s name or IP address.
During the Trend Micro Security server installation, the installer identifies the server computer’s IP addresses, which are then displayed on the Web console’s Client-Server Communication screen.
The server communicates with clients through the listening port, which is port number 61617 by default.
If you change the port number, ensure that it is not currently in use to prevent conflicts with other applications and client-server communication issues.
If a firewall application is in use on the server computer, ensure that the firewall does not block client-server communication through the listening port.
For example, if the OfficeScan client firewall has been enabled on the computer, add a policy exception that allows incoming and outgoing traffic through the listening port.
firewall
You can configure clients to connect to the server through a proxy server.
A proxy server, however, is usually not required for client-server connections within the corporate network.
If you need to configure the server name/IP address, listening port, and proxy server settings, configure them before installing clients.
If you have installed clients and then change any of these settings, clients will lose connection with the server and the only way to re-establish connection is to re-deploy the clients.
server name/IP address
To configure client-server communication settings:
Administration  Client-Server Communication
Type the server’s name or IP address(es), and listening port.
If there are multiple entries in the Server name (or IP address) field, the client randomly selects an entry.
Ensure that client-server connection can be established using all the entries.
Select whether clients connect to the server through a proxy server.
Select the proxy server protocol.
Type the proxy server name or IP address, and port number.

Scan_Actions
Scan Actions
scan actions
Specify the action Trend Micro Security performs when a particular scan type detects a security risk.
The action Trend Micro Security performs depends on the scan type that detected the security risk.
For example, when Trend Micro Security detects a security risk during Manual Scan (scan type), it cleans (action) the infected file.
Actions
The following are the actions Trend Micro Security can perform against security risks:
Delete
Trend Micro Security removes the infected file from the computer.
Quarantine
quarantine
Trend Micro Security renames and then moves the infected file to the quarantine directory on the client computer located in /common/lib/vsapi/quarantine.
Once in the quarantine directory, Trend Micro Security can perform another action on the quarantined file, depending on the action specified by the user.
Trend Micro Security can delete, clean, or restore the file.
Restoring a file means moving it back to its original location without performing any action.
Users may restore the file if it is actually harmless.
Cleaning a file means removing the security risk from the quarantined file and then moving it to its original location if cleaning is successful.
Clean
clean files
Trend Micro Security removes the security risk from an infected file before allowing users to access it.
If the file is uncleanable, Trend Micro Security performs a second action, which can be one of the following actions:
Delete:
Removes the infected file permanently from the computer.
Pass:
Quarantine:
Quarantine, Delete, and Pass.
To configure the second action, navigate to Client Management  Settings  {Scan Type}  Action tab.
Pass
Trend Micro Security performs no action on the infected file but records the detected security risk in the logs.
The file stays where it is located.
Trend Micro Security always performs "Pass" on files infected with the  type to mitigate a .
If further analysis confirms that probable virus/malware is indeed a security risk, a new pattern will be released to allow Trend Micro Security to perform the appropriate scan action.
If actually harmless, probable virus/malware will no longer be detected.
For example:
Trend Micro Security detects "x_probable_virus" on a file named "123.pdf" and performs no action at the time of detection.
Trend Micro then confirms that "x_probable_virus" is a Trojan horse program and releases a new Virus Pattern version.
After loading the new pattern, Trend Micro Security will detect "x_probable_virus" as a Trojan program and, if the action against such programs is "Delete", will delete "123.pdf".
Scan Action Options
When configuring the scan action, select from the following options:
ActiveAction is a set of pre-configured scan actions for different types of security risks.
If you are unsure which scan action is suitable for a certain type of security risk, Trend Micro recommends using ActiveAction.
ActiveAction
ActiveAction settings are constantly updated in the pattern files to protect computers against the latest security risks and the latest methods of attacks.
Use the same action for all security risk types
Select this option if you want the same action performed on all types of security risks, except probable virus/malware.
For , the action is always "Pass".
If you choose "Clean" as the first action, select a second action that Trend Micro Security performs if cleaning is unsuccessful.
If the first action is not "Clean", no second action is configurable.
Display a Notification Message When a Security Risk is Detected
When Trend Micro Security detects a security risk during Real-time Scan, it can display a notification message to inform the user about the detection.
notifications
Allow Users to Postpone or Cancel Scheduled Scan
Trend Micro Security displays a notification message five minutes before Scheduled Scan runs.
