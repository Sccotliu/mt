The newly designed dashboard for the License Management Platform provides a comprehensive view of events, while clearly prioritizing actions that need to be taken. Trend Micro has focused on making all key tasks, just one-click away.
Dashboard with Actionable Intelligence
Due to the enhancements in the background provisioning mechanism, Trend has made it easier to switch from different products or product sets to a suite product set. This has been accomplished by eliminating manual steps for our partners and improving the overall usability for cross-grade scenarios.
Suite Cross-grade
With this new functionality changes do not have to be made in real-time or near real-time, but rather can be planned and schedule
Licensing change scheduling
To ensure key functionalities are always accessible, the shortcut buttons have been created. These buttons follow other Trend Micro product concepts to ensure the most common tasks are always accessible via the shortcut buttons. The shortcut button concept follows Trend Micro’s concept of a “One-Click” user interface that enables administrators to have the key functions always at hand.
