The following table provides other considerations when switching agents to smart scan.
Ensure that agents can connect to the server.
Only online agents will be notified to switch to smart scan.
Offline agents get notified when they become online.
Switching a relatively small number of agents at a time allows efficient use of server resources.
The server can perform other critical tasks while agents change their scan methods.
The Smart Scan Pattern is only used by smart scan agents.
Also consider switching when no agent is scheduled to update from the server.
Create a new group and assign smart scan as its scan method.
Any agent you move to this group will use smart scan.
Select a group and configure it to use smart scan.
Conventional scan agents belonging to the group will switch to smart scan.
Smart scan agents send scan queries to smart protection sources.
A pure IPv6 smart scan agent cannot send queries directly to pure IPv4 sources, such as:
IPv6 support for Smart Protection Server starts in version 2.5.
Similarly, a pure IPv4 smart scan agent cannot send queries to pure IPv6 Smart Protection Servers.

The action is configured by the productname administrator.
Quick Scan: Scans areas of the endpoint typically targeted by security risks.
The pattern files on the agent contain information on the endpoint areas to scan.
Custom Scan: Scans the files or folders of your choice.
Run custom scan on files or folders that you suspect to be infected.
Wait for the scan to finish and check the results.

When scanning restarts, all previously scanned files are scanned again.
Scheduled Scan can be stopped and then restarted only once.
Configure the number of hours and minutes, which corresponds to:
The maximum amount of time that should elapse before scanning restarts
This privilege allows users to perform the following actions:
Stop Scheduled Scan when it is in progress

The agent immediately notifies users of any security risk detected during scanning.
Restoring a file means moving it back to its original location without performing any action.
Users may restore the file if it is actually harmless.
If actually harmless, probable virus/malware will no longer be detected.
The file is located under the directory path specified in the scan exclusion list
The following table provides a comparison between the two scan methods:
Available in this version and all earlier versions.
The conventional scan agent performs scanning on the local endpoint.
The smart scan agent performs scanning on the local endpoint.
All components available on the update source, except the Smart Scan Agent Pattern.
agents can use one of two scan methods when scanning for security risks.
The scan methods are smart scan and conventional scan.
Agents that use smart scan are referred to as smart scan agents in this document.
Agents that do not use smart scan are called conventional scan agents.
A conventional scan agent stores all components on the agent endpoint and scans all files locally.
Initiate Scan Now on endpoints that you suspect to be infected.
The agent is not always able to perform a desired action on detected threats.
When this happens one of the following scan results will appear.
The infected file may be locked by another application, is executing, or is on a CD.

productname protects endpoints from the following virus/malware types:
This program often uses Trojan ports to gain access to endpoints.
Boot sector virus: A virus that infects the boot sector of a partition or a disk
Macro virus: A virus encoded as an application macro and often included in a document
A test virus is an inert file that is detectable by virus scanning software.
Packers are compressed and/or encrypted Windows or Linux executable programs, often a Trojan horse program.
Compressing executables makes packers more difficult for antivirus products to detect.
Suspicious files that have some of the characteristics of virus/malware are categorized under this virus/malware type.
For details about probable virus/malware, see the following page on the Trend Micro online Virus Encyclopedia:
Check if the endpoint meets the requirements for installing and running productname server.
Check if the following services have been started:
If the file does not exist, enable debug logging.
Reproduce the steps that led to the web console access problem.
Check if the productname database instance on the Microsoft SQL server registry key exists:
Click FileExport and then save the registry key to a .reg file.
If this service is not running, there may be a problem with the ActiveMQ service.
Try to access the web console again to check if the access problem has been resolved.
Verify that you have typed the correct user name and password.
Contact your service providor if the problem persists.
It will then continue to scan sites and block users from accessing infected ones.
Web threats encompass a broad array of threats that originate from the Internet.
For example, web threat creators constantly change the version or variant used.
Web threats help these individuals pursue one of two goals.
One goal is to steal information for subsequent sale.
The resulting impact is leakage of confidential information in the form of identity loss.
For details on working with widgets, see the OfficeScan documentation.
Actions on security risks are configured by the productname administrator.
Restore: Moves the file back to its original location.
Choose this action if you think a file has been incorrectly detected as infected.
Delete: Removes the infected file permanently from the computer.

ActiveUpdate is a function common to many Trend Micro products.
A false positive occurs when a file is incorrectly detected by security software as infected.
HTTPS is a variant of HTTP used for handling secure transactions.
IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.
IntelliScan does not affect applications on the client because it uses minimal system resources.
Because IntelliScan uses true file type identification, it only scans files that are vulnerable to infection.
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.
A listening port is utilized for client connection requests for data exchange.
The email tells the user to log on to the site and confirm some account information.
Phish fraud is fast, cheap, and easy to perpetuate.
It is also potentially quite lucrative for those criminals who practice it.
And it is hard for law enforcement to track down.
