A pure IPv6 server cannot connect through a pure IPv4 proxy server.
Real-time Scan is a persistent and ongoing scan.
In the agent tree, select the group to rename.
The new group name appears in the agent tree.
Prepare the backup of the database files created during backup.
Use the attach option to attach the backup of the database files.
Manual Scan checks for security risks and also eradicates old infections to minimize reinfection.
The scanning duration depends on the computer's hardware resources and the number of files to scan.
During a Manual Scan, the agent performs a specific action against detected security risks.
The action is configured by the productname administrator.
Quick Scan: Scans areas of the endpoint typically targeted by security risks.
The pattern files on the agent contain information on the endpoint areas to scan.
Custom Scan: Scans the files or folders of your choice.
Run custom scan on files or folders that you suspect to be infected.
Full Scan: Scans all files, except encrypted and password-protected files.
Wait for the scan to finish and check the results.
You can stop or pause scanning while it is in progress.
Click Scan and choose one of the following scan options:
The agent receives updates automatically from the server.
When configuring the scan action, select from the following options:
ActiveAction is a set of pre-configured scan actions for different types of security risks.
Use the same action for all security risk types
For Probable Virus/Malware, the action is always "Pass".
If the first action is not "Clean", no second action is configurable.
Display a notification message when a security risk is detected
If Scheduled Scan is enabled on the endpoint, users can postpone and skip/stop Scheduled Scan.
Users with the "Postpone Scheduled Scan" privilege can perform the following actions:
Postpone Scheduled Scan before it runs and then specify the postpone duration.
If Scheduled Scan is in progress, users can stop scanning and restart it later.
Users then specify the amount of time that should elapse before scanning restarts.
When scanning restarts, all previously scanned files are scanned again.
Scheduled Scan can be stopped and then restarted only once.
Configure the number of hours and minutes, which corresponds to:
The maximum amount of time that should elapse before scanning restarts
This privilege allows users to perform the following actions:
Stop Scheduled Scan when it is in progress
Configure the timing for displaying the notification message, in number of minutes.
Automatically stop Scheduled Scan when scanning lasts more than __ hours and __ minutes
The agent immediately notifies users of any security risk detected during scanning.
The following are the actions Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can perform against security risks:
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) removes the infected file from the endpoint.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can delete, clean, or restore the file.
Restoring a file means moving it back to its original location without performing any action.
Users may restore the file if it is actually harmless.
To configure the second action, navigate to Agent ManagementSettings{Scan Type} and click the Action tab.
If actually harmless, probable virus/malware will no longer be detected.
For example, configure Real-time Scan to scan each file after it is downloaded to the endpoint.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will not scan a file if:
The file is located under the directory path specified in the scan exclusion list
The following table provides a comparison between the two scan methods:
Available in this version and all earlier versions.
The conventional scan agent performs scanning on the local endpoint.
The smart scan agent performs scanning on the local endpoint.
The agent "caches" the scan query result to improve the scan performance.
All components available on the update source, except the Smart Scan Agent Pattern.
All components available on the update source, except the Virus Pattern and Spyware Active-monitoring Pattern.
agents can use one of two scan methods when scanning for security risks.
The scan methods are smart scan and conventional scan.
Agents that use smart scan are referred to as smart scan agents in this document.
Smart scan agents benefit from local scans and in-the-cloud queries provided by File Reputation Services.
Agents that do not use smart scan are called conventional scan agents.
A conventional scan agent stores all components on the agent endpoint and scans all files locally.
Initiate Scan Now on endpoints that you suspect to be infected.
The agent is not always able to perform a desired action on detected threats.
When this happens one of the following scan results will appear.
The infected file may be locked by another application, is executing, or is on a CD.
will delete the file after the application releases the file or after it has been executed.
The following scan results display in the virus/malware logs:
First action is Delete and the infected file was deleted.
First action is Clean but cleaning was unsuccessful.
Second action is Delete and the infected file was deleted.
First action is Quarantine and the infected file was quarantined.
Second action is Quarantine and the infected file was quarantined.
productname did not perform any action on the infected file.
Second action is Pass so productname did not perform any action on the infected file.
Quarantine is the second action, and both actions were unsuccessful.
Solution: See “Unable to quarantine the file” below.
Delete is the second action, and both actions were unsuccessful.
Solution: See “Unable to delete the file” below.
Type a full file path or directory path and then click Add.
To delete a directory path or full file path, select it and then click Remove.
Scan compressed files: Allows productname can scan individual files within compressed files.

Trend Micro always seeks to improve its documentation.
Please evaluate this documentation on the following site:
Web threats encompass a broad array of threats that originate from the Internet.
For example, Web threat creators constantly change the version or variant used.
Web threats help these individuals pursue one of two goals.
One goal is to steal information for subsequent sale.
The resulting impact is leakage of confidential information in the form of identity loss.
The infected computer may also become a vector to deliver or other information capturing activities.
The Web site’s reputation is correlated with the specific Web reputation policy enforced on the computer.
Policies are enforced based on the client’s location.
To determine the appropriate policy to use, Trend Micro Security checks the client's location.
A client's location is "internal" if it can connect to the Trend Micro Security server.
Configure a policy for External Clients and Internal Clients.
Select the check box to enable the Web reputation policy.
Select from the available Web reputation security levels:
The security levels determine whether Trend Micro Security will allow or block access to a URL.
If you selected the root icon , choose from the following options:
Applies settings to all existing clients and to any new client added to an existing/future group.
Future groups are groups not yet created at the time you configure the settings.
Applies settings only to clients added to future groups.
This option will not apply settings to new clients added to an existing group.
Add URLs that you consider safe to the approved URL list.
You can add a wildcard character (*) anywhere on the URL.
www.trendmicro.com/* means that all pages under www.trendmicro.com will be approved.
*.trendmicro.com/* means that all pages on any sub-domain of trendmicro.com will be approved.
To delete an entry, click the icon next to an approved URL.
Configure internal clients to send Web reputation logs to the server.
For more information about managing logs, see .
Specify the log criteria and click Display Logs.

A false positive occurs when a file is incorrectly detected by security software as infected.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
HTTPS is a variant of HTTP used for handling secure transactions.
IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.
IntelliScan does not affect applications on the client because it uses minimal system resources.
Because IntelliScan uses true file type identification, it only scans files that are vulnerable to infection.
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.
Java is a general-purpose programming language developed by Sun Microsystems.
Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java "applets".
A listening port is utilized for client connection requests for data exchange.
The email tells the user to log on to the site and confirm some account information.
Phish fraud is fast, cheap, and easy to perpetuate.
It is also potentially quite lucrative for those criminals who practice it.
Phish is hard for even computer-savvy users to detect.
And it is hard for law enforcement to track down.
Please report to Trend Micro any Web site you suspect to be a phishing site.
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a protocol designed by Netscape for providing data security layered between
application protocols (such as HTTP, Telnet, or FTP) and TCP/IP.
TCP relies on IP datagrams for address resolution.
Refer to DARPA Internet Program RFC 793 for information.
Refer to Network Working Group RFC 854 for more information.
