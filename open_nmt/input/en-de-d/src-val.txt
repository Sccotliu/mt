Malware Behavior Blocking also detects threats and takes action on them.
Used to enable all features that may otherwise be restricted by the administrator.
Displays information about the current state of the trend_client_program_single and the computer_device that it protects.
It could also mean bypassing the security of a network or computer_device.
Intrusions refer to entry into networks or computer_device_plural either by force or without permission.
This can freeze or slow down the computer_device.
Similar to an overlapping fragment attack, this Denial of Service attack deals with IP fragments.
This overwrites the header information in the first TCP fragment and may pass through a firewall.
This can exhaust computer_device memory and eventually crash the computer_device.
This can cause the computer_device's buffer to overflow, which can freeze or reboot the computer_device.
The product_short_name firewall can help prevent the following well-known intrusions:
The product_short_name firewall also includes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.
Because IntelliScan uses true file type identification, it only scans files that are vulnerable to infection.
IntelliScan does not affect applications on the client_computer_single because it uses minimal system resources.
IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.
Hot fixes are issue-specific, and therefore not released to all customers.
A hot fix is a workaround or solution to a single customer-reported issue.
This appendix describes how to get help, find additional information, and contact Trend Micro.

This option is not supported for Program Library Injections on 64-bit systems.
This is the default action for all monitored system events.
The following table lists possible actions that administrators can take on monitored system events.
When Event Monitoring detects a monitored system event, it performs the action configured for the event.
These actions can include terminating or modifying running processes.
Many malicious programs perform various actions on built-in Windows processes.
Many malicious programs modify system files to launch automatically at startup and control system behavior.
Certain Windows system files determine system behavior, including startup programs and screen saver settings.
Malicious programs sometimes install themselves as services to stay hidden.
Many malicious programs modify Windows shell settings to associate themselves to certain file types.
This allows the malicious routines in the DLL to run every time an application starts.
Many malicious programs configure Windows so that all applications automatically load a program library (DLL).
Modifications in Windows Security Policy can allow unwanted applications to run and change system settings.
Spyware/grayware programs often install unwanted Internet Explorer plugins, including toolbars and Browser Helper Objects.
Programs exhibiting suspicious behavior should be used with caution.

Probable viruses/malware are suspicious files that have some of the characteristics of viruses/malware.
They often do not alter system files or modify the boot sectors of hard disks.
Only some virus/malware types, such as worms, qualify as network viruses.
A virus spreading over a network is not, strictly speaking, a network virus.
A virus that resides on web pages and downloaded through a browser.
A virus encoded as an application macro and often included in a document.
Operating system-independent virus code written or embedded in Java.
An executable program with .com or .exe extension.
A virus that infects the boot sector of a partition or a disk.
Code that resides on web pages that execute ActiveX controls.
Trojan horse programs often use ports to gain access to computers or executable programs.
They use stealth to maintain a persistent and undetectable presence on the machine.
Compressing executables makes packers more difficult for antivirus products to detect.
Packers are compressed and/or encrypted Windows or Linux executable programs, often a Trojan horse program.
Others include viruses/malware not categorized under any of the other virus/malware types.
Joke programs are virus-like programs that often manipulate the appearance of things on the computer_device's monitor.

product_short_name provides the following scan types to protect trend_client_program_single computers from security risks:
Modify the scan settings from the web console by going to and clicking Settings {Scan Type}.
product_short_name provides several types of scans to protect computer_device_plural from security risks.
This option is available only for Real-time Scan.
Enable IntelliTrap: Detects and removes virus/malware on compressed executable files.
product_short_name will scan the Word document and Excel spreadsheet, and skip the .exe file.
The number of layers you specify is 2.
Each layer is scanned for virus/malware and spyware/grayware.
Office Open XML, the file format for Office 2007 applications, uses ZIP compression technologies.
product_short_name treats Microsoft Office 2007 files in Office Open XML format as compressed files.
If a compressed file contains security threats, product_short_name cleans or deletes the file.
product_short_name also cleans or deletes infected files within compressed files.
This feature requires that administrators enable the Unauthorized Change Prevention Service and the Advanced Protection Service.
If a malware threat exists, Real-Time scan quarantines the process and/or file.
This prevents any virus/malware from executing when a user reboots the endpoint from the disk.
Select one or more of the following options:
The file is not located in the Windows system directory.
You can add files to the Trusted Programs List if the following requirements are met:
Add trusted programs to the Trusted Program List to improve the performance of scanning on endpoints.
You can configure product_short_name to skip scanning of trusted processes during Real-time and Behavior Monitoring scans.
Users can customize an individual Trusted Program List.
The trend_client_program_single can use cache settings to improve its scan performance.
Users enable scanning of POP3 email messages for virus/malware.
Users can postpone, stop, or skip Scheduled Scan.
Users can configure Manual Scan, Scheduled Scan, and Real-time Scan settings.
Scan privileges allow users or the trend_client_program_single to perform the following tasks:
Users with scan privileges have greater control over how files on their computers get scanned.
All components available on the update source, except the Virus Pattern and Spyware Active-monitoring Pattern
All components available on the update source, except the Smart Scan Agent Pattern
The client_computer_single "caches" the scan query result to improve the scan performance.
The smart scan client_computer_single performs scanning on the local computer_device.
The conventional scan client_computer_single performs scanning on the local computer_device.
Available in this product_short_name version and all earlier product_short_name versions
The following table provides a comparison between the two scan methods:
client_computer_plural_cap that do not use smart scan are called conventional scan client_computer_plural.
Smart scan client_computer_plural benefit from local scans and in-the-cloud queries provided by File Reputation Services.
client_computer_plural_cap that use smart scan are referred to as smart scan client_computer_plural in this document.
The client_computer_single will apply the scan method for that domain after the installation.
The destination is the domain name that appears in the client_computer_single tree.
If the target computer_device belongs to a particular source, check the corresponding Destination.
If the client_computer_single grouping is by custom client_computer_single groups, check the Grouping Priority and Source.
If the domain exists, check the scan method configured for the domain.
On the web console, go to OSCE Client Grouping.
The domain level scan method should be consistent with the scan method for the package.
For details on the components available for each scan method, see .
The components included in the package depend on the scan method you have selected.
product_short_name also allows you to customize the scan method for each domain after installing the server.
During fresh installations, the default scan method for client_computer_plural is the Smart Scan method.
This agent grouping method allows for the creation of new domains.
In the product_short_name product_version server, choose manual agent grouping.
In this product_short_name version, administrators can configure agents to use either Smart Scan or Conventional Scan.
In this product_short_name version, you can configure client_computer_plural to use either Smart Scan or Conventional Scan.

The trend_client_program_single can only be installed on the following operating systems that support IPv6 addressing:
Open ports 135 and the newly created fixed port (24158) for communication through the firewall.
For details on Setting Up a Fixed Port for WMI, refer to:
If the connection to the Hyper-V server is unsuccessful, configure WMI to use a fixed port.
For details about opening ports, refer to your firewall documentation.
Opening Port Communication through the Windows Firewall or a Third-party Firewall
A subsequent request uses an existing open connection.
Each request is a CGI-like command query or log transmission.
To address this issue, MCP uses one-way communication.
NAT traversal has become an increasingly more significant issue in the current real-world network environment.
The caches also expire longer, which means that more files are skipped from scans.
If on-demand scans are run frequently, the on-demand scan cache file reduces the scanning time significantly.
Each time scanning runs, the trend_client_program_single checks the properties of threat-free files.
For more information on Compliance Reports, see .
Reports help you assess the security status of trend_client_program_plural managed by the product_short_name server.

Running the Touch Tool for TrendMicroEndpoint Hot Fixes
This chapter describes product_name components and update procedures.
Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java "applets".
Java is a general-purpose programming language developed by Sun Microsystems.
This topic explains the tasks that you need to perform to update an isolated product_short_name server.
Pure IPv6 trend_client_program_plural cannot install plug-in solutions because none of the plug-in solutions support IPv6.
If you are installing the product_short_name server to a pure IPv6 endpoint:
The FQDN can only be specified when performing a local installation of the server.
The server can be identified by its host name or IPv6 address.
If the server will manage only IPv6 agents, the minimum requirement is an IPv6 address.
If a server is identified by its IPv4 address, IPv6 agents cannot connect to the server.
The server must use an IIS web server.
The IPv6 requirements for the product_short_name server fresh installation are as follows:
The server must already be using an IIS web server.
The product_short_name server to be upgraded must be version 10.6 SP3 or 11.x.
The IPv6 requirements for the product_short_name server and agent upgrades are as follows:
For fresh installations, select IIS server to enable IPv6 support.
This appendix contains information on the extent of IPv6 support in product_short_name.
A pure IPv6 Update Agent cannot update directly from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
A pure IPv6 client_computer_single cannot update directly from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
Similarly, a pure IPv4 client_computer_single cannot send queries to pure IPv6 Smart Protection Servers.
IPv6 support for Smart Protection Server starts in version 2.5.
A pure IPv6 client_computer_single cannot send queries directly to pure IPv4 sources, such as:
Similarly, a pure IPv4 product_short_name server cannot update directly from pure IPv6 custom update sources.
A pure IPv6 product_short_name server cannot update directly from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
Earlier product_short_name versions do not support IPv6 addressing.
IPv6 support for product_short_name started in version 10.6.
Server identification can be by its host name or IPv6 address.
If the server manages only IPv6 client_computer_plural, the minimum requirement is an IPv6 address.
If administrators identify the server by its IPv4 address, IPv6 client_computer_plural cannot connect to the server.
