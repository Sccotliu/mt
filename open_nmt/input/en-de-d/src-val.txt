This is the default action for all monitored system events.
The following table lists possible actions that administrators can take on monitored system events.
When Event Monitoring detects a monitored system event, it performs the action configured for the event.
These actions can include terminating or modifying running processes.
Many malicious programs modify system files to launch automatically at startup and control system behavior.
Certain Windows system files determine system behavior, including startup programs and screen saver settings.
Malicious programs sometimes install themselves as services to stay hidden.
Many malicious programs modify Windows shell settings to associate themselves to certain file types.
This allows the malicious routines in the DLL to run every time an application starts.
Modifications in Windows Security Policy can allow unwanted applications to run and change system settings.
Spyware/grayware programs often install unwanted Internet Explorer plugins, including toolbars and Browser Helper Objects.
Programs exhibiting suspicious behavior should be used with caution.

For details, see the Trend Micro Threat Encyclopedia:
Probable viruses/malware are suspicious files that have some of the characteristics of viruses/malware.
They often do not alter system files or modify the boot sectors of hard disks.
Only some virus/malware types, such as worms, qualify as network viruses.
A virus spreading over a network is not, strictly speaking, a network virus.
A virus that resides on web pages and downloaded through a browser.
A virus encoded as an application macro and often included in a document.
An executable program with .com or .exe extension.
A virus that infects the boot sector of a partition or a disk.
Code that resides on web pages that execute ActiveX controls.
Trojan horse programs often use ports to gain access to computers or executable programs.
They use stealth to maintain a persistent and undetectable presence on the machine.
Compressing executables makes packers more difficult for antivirus products to detect.
Packers are compressed and/or encrypted Windows or Linux executable programs, often a Trojan horse program.
Others include viruses/malware not categorized under any of the other virus/malware types.
Tens of thousands of virus/malware exist, with more being created each day.
