The server downloads the incremental patterns it does not have.
The server compares its current incremental patterns with the incremental patterns available on the ActiveUpdate server.
The server generates incremental patterns based on the other full patterns available on the server.
The server has 1 incremental pattern (171.175) and the latest full pattern (version 175).
On the server, TMEndpointEdt merges version 171 with incremental pattern 171.175 to generate version 175.
This incremental pattern accounts for the difference between versions 171 and 175.
In other words, the server does not have versions 173 and 175.
The difference between versions 171 and 175 is 2.
