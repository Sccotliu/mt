Data Loss Prevention evaluates condition statements from left to right.
Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements.
Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results.
A file must satisfy [Data Identifier 1] and [Data Identifier 2] but not [Data Identifier 3].
A file must satisfy [Data Identifier 1] or [Data Identifier 2].
A file must be [an Adobe PDF document] or [a Microsoft Word document].
A file must not satisfy [Data Identifier 1].
A file must not be [a multimedia file].
In most cases, however, the first data identifier does not have an operator.
In the United States, Trend Micro representatives are available by phone or email:
An expression must include the characters you have specified.
Suffix refers to the last segment of an expression.
A suffix must include the characters you have specified and contain a certain number of characters.
An expression must have two segments separated by a character.
The character must be 1 byte in length.
The number of characters right of the separator must not exceed the maximum limit.
Create your own templates if you have configured data identifiers.
A template combines data identifiers and logical operators (And, Or, Except) to form condition statements.
For more information and examples on how condition statements and logical operators work, see .
Create customized expressions if none of the predefined expressions meet the company's requirements.
Become comfortable with expression syntax before creating expressions.
Refer to the predefined expressions for guidance on how to define valid expressions.
Note that Data Loss Prevention follows the expression formats defined in Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE).
For more information on PCRE, visit the following website:
Modify the expressions if they are causing false alarms or fine tune them to improve detections.
Administrators can choose from several criteria when creating expressions.
For details about the different criteria options, see .
A file must contain at least one keyword in the keyword list.
A file must contain all the keywords in the keyword list.
In addition, each keyword pair must be within  characters of each other.
The following data does not match the criteria: DISK*******************WEB****USB(23 characters between "D" and "W")
This may reduce the likelihood of detecting sensitive data, especially in large files.
As the number increases, the area covered also increases but scanning time might be slower.
A file must contain one or more keywords in the keyword list.
If only one keyword was detected, its score must be higher than the threshold.
If there are several keywords, their combined score must be higher than the threshold.
Assign each keyword a score of 1 to 10.
Words or phrases that, by themselves, do not carry much weight can have lower scores.
Consider the scores that you assigned to the keywords when configuring the threshold.
Create customized keyword lists if none of the predefined keyword lists meet your requirements.
There are several criteria that you can choose from when configuring a keyword list.
Choose one of the following criteria for each keyword list:
For details regarding the criteria rules, see .
Digital assets are files and data that an organization must protect against unauthorized transmission.
Administrators can define digital assets using the following data identifiers:
File attributes: File properties such as file type and file size.
Keyword lists: A list of special words or phrases.
Administrators cannot delete a data identifier that a DLP template is using.
Delete the template before deleting the data identifier.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the expressions.
Click Import and then locate the .dat file containing the expressions.
A message appears, informing you if the import was successful.
If an expression to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
The name must not exceed expression_name_length bytes in length and cannot contain the following characters:
Type a description that does not exceed 256 bytes in length.
Type the expression and specify whether it is case-sensitive.
For example, if you are creating an expression for ID numbers, type a sample ID number.
This data is used for reference purposes only and will not appear elsewhere in the product.
Choose one of the following criteria and configure additional settings for the chosen criteria (see ):
Click Save if you are satisfied with the result.
Save the settings only if the testing was successful.
An expression that cannot detect any data wastes system resources and may impact performance.
An expression is data that has a certain structure.
Type a name for the file attribute list.
The asterisk is a wildcard, which represents a file’s actual name.
There is no need to add a space after a semicolon.
Type the minimum and maximum file sizes in bytes.
Both file sizes must be whole numbers larger than zero.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted filetype file containing the file attribute lists.

Hosted Email Security currently supports either of the following for SSO:
Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0
Before configuring SSO settings, configure AD FS 2.0 or Azure AD to complete federation server settings.
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an open standard to prevent sender address forgery.
For example, which email servers they use to send email from their domain.
If, for example, the message comes from an unknown server, it can be considered as fake.

About Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security for Mac
Some of the types of threats your Mac may face
Most of these threats do not yet pose a serious risk to your Mac.
In some cases, however, data miners can steal personal information like passwords and credit card numbers.

Some spyware just keeps track of the websites you visit.
Such programs then take unwanted actions, often in secret, compromising the security of the host computer.
Unlike computer viruses, Trojan horse programs do not typically reproduce themselves.

Compressing a file sent from one computer to another reduces the burden on the network connection.
For large files, that can often save a lot of time.
Most compressed files contain only a single "layer."
A compressed file that itself contains other compressed files has "multiple layers."
For example, suppose a compressed file called pets.zip contains cats.doc, dogs.zip, birds.doc, and fish.doc.
In this case, dogs.zip is also a compressed file containing beagles.doc and poodles.doc.
Trend Micro Titanium can find malicious software lurking inside multiple layers of compressed files.
Trend Micro Titanium can check the following types of compressed files:
.BIN - MacBinary encoded file or CD image
.GZ; .GZIP - UNIX or GNU ZIP archive
.MHT - Multipurpose Internet mail HTML file (web archive file)
.ZIP - compressed file created by PKzip or 7-zip
Records info about scans, unsafe websites, and updates
Trend Micro Titanium keeps records of what it has done to protect you.
In the logs, you can see all of the details, arranged into four categories:
Updates Received This list shows all of theTrend Micro Titanium components that have been updated.
Trend Micro Titanium maintains these records until you empty a particular list.
Trend Micro uses proprietary methods to identify websites that might pose a risk.
You might not want to access some "safe" websites for other reasons, of course.
Websites added to the Approved List are automatically listed as Trusted, and are not checked.
They could also have some association with junk email.
For example, the address of a website in this category may haveappeared in junk email before.
Websites added to the Blocked List are automatically listed as Blocked, and are not checked.
No Response  Trend Micro Titanium cannot contact the page rating system.
Check your Internet connection and proxy server settings..
What Titanium does when it finds a threat
Trend Micro Titanium can respond to malicious software in four different ways.
It will normally try each response in the order shown below.
You should always let Trend Micro Titanium try to clean unsafe files.
Trend Micro Titanium cannot clean these files, and must isolate them instead.
Once quarantined, malicious software cannot cause any harm.
Trend Micro Titanium will also quarantine currently uncleanable files that might become possible to disinfect later.
Delete Trend Micro Titanium can almost alwaysclean or quarantine malicious software successfully.
You can then try to delete the file yourself.
How to prevent Titanium from scanning certain files
You should not include a period before the characters.
Trend Micro Titanium does not allow "wildcard" characters (like "." or ":")
Trend Micro Titanium can protect you with three major kinds of scans:
For "on-demand" or scheduled scans, you have three scanning options:
Smart Scan This kind of scan checks only the files most likely to contain malicious software.
Full Scan This kind of scan checks every file on your Mac for malicious software.
If unable to remove the malicious software, Trend Micro Titanium will quarantine the file.
The different levels of protection for your Mac
Low Trend Micro Titanium will only block websites verified as dangerous.
These sites can transmit malicious software or actively support online fraud.
It will also block unrated sites that show basic signs of posing a threat.
High Trend Micro Titanium blocks all websites stopped by the previous levels.
