Data Loss Prevention evaluates condition statements from left to right.
Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements.
Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results.
In most cases, however, the first data identifier does not have an operator.
In the United States, Trend Micro representatives are available by phone or email:
An expression must include the characters you have specified.
Suffix refers to the last segment of an expression.
A suffix must include the characters you have specified and contain a certain number of characters.
An expression must have two segments separated by a character.
The character must be 1 byte in length.
The number of characters right of the separator must not exceed the maximum limit.
Create your own templates if you have configured data identifiers.
For more information and examples on how condition statements and logical operators work, see .
Become comfortable with expression syntax before creating expressions.
Refer to the predefined expressions for guidance on how to define valid expressions.
For more information on PCRE, visit the following website:
Modify the expressions if they are causing false alarms or fine tune them to improve detections.
Administrators can choose from several criteria when creating expressions.
For details about the different criteria options, see .
A file must contain at least one keyword in the keyword list.
A file must contain all the keywords in the keyword list.
In addition, each keyword pair must be within  characters of each other.
This may reduce the likelihood of detecting sensitive data, especially in large files.
As the number increases, the area covered also increases but scanning time might be slower.
A file must contain one or more keywords in the keyword list.
If only one keyword was detected, its score must be higher than the threshold.
If there are several keywords, their combined score must be higher than the threshold.
Assign each keyword a score of 1 to 10.
Words or phrases that, by themselves, do not carry much weight can have lower scores.
Consider the scores that you assigned to the keywords when configuring the threshold.
Create customized keyword lists if none of the predefined keyword lists meet your requirements.
There are several criteria that you can choose from when configuring a keyword list.
Choose one of the following criteria for each keyword list:
For details regarding the criteria rules, see .
Digital assets are files and data that an organization must protect against unauthorized transmission.
Administrators can define digital assets using the following data identifiers:

About Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security for Mac
Some of the types of threats your Mac may face
Most of these threats do not yet pose a serious risk to your Mac.
In some cases, however, data miners can steal personal information like passwords and credit card numbers.
Keyloggers These programs keep track of the keys that you press on your keyboard.
Some spyware just keeps track of the websites you visit.
Such programs then take unwanted actions, often in secret, compromising the security of the host computer.
Unlike computer viruses, Trojan horse programs do not typically reproduce themselves.

Compressing a file sent from one computer to another reduces the burden on the network connection.
For large files, that can often save a lot of time.
For example, suppose a compressed file called pets.zip contains cats.doc, dogs.zip, birds.doc, and fish.doc.
In this case, dogs.zip is also a compressed file containing beagles.doc and poodles.doc.
Trend Micro Titanium can find malicious software lurking inside multiple layers of compressed files.
Trend Micro Titanium can check the following types of compressed files:
Records info about scans, unsafe websites, and updates
Trend Micro Titanium keeps records of what it has done to protect you.
In the logs, you can see all of the details, arranged into four categories:

Trend Micro uses proprietary methods to identify websites that might pose a risk.
Websites added to the Approved List are automatically listed as Trusted, and are not checked.
They could also have some association with junk email.

Websites added to the Blocked List are automatically listed as Blocked, and are not checked.

It will normally try each response in the order shown below.
You should always let Trend Micro Titanium try to clean unsafe files.
Trend Micro Titanium cannot clean these files, and must isolate them instead.
